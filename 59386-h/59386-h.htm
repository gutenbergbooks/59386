<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE" id="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</a><br />

<small>BY ALFRED R. WALLACE</small></h2>


<p>Having read the proofs of Mr. Westermarck’s book I am
asked by the publishers to say a few words by way of introducing
the work to English readers. This I have great
pleasure in doing, because I have seldom read a more
thorough or a more philosophic discussion of some of the
most difficult, and at the same time interesting problems of
anthropology.</p>

<p>The origin and development of human marriage have been
discussed by such eminent writers as Darwin, Spencer,
Morgan, Lubbock, and many others. On some of the
more important questions involved in it all these writers
are in general accord, and this agreement has led to their
opinions being widely accepted as if they were well-established
conclusions of science. But on several of these points
Mr. Westermarck has arrived at different, and sometimes
diametrically opposite, conclusions, and he has done so after
a most complete and painstaking investigation of all the
available facts.</p>

<p>With such an array of authority on the one side and a
hitherto unknown student on the other, it will certainly be
thought that all the probabilities are against the latter. Yet
I venture to anticipate that the verdict of independent
thinkers will, on most of these disputed points, be in favour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
the new comer who has so boldly challenged the conclusions
of some of our most esteemed writers. Even those whose
views are here opposed, will, I think, acknowledge that Mr.
Westermarck is a careful investigator and an acute reasoner,
and that his arguments as well as his conclusions are worthy
of the most careful consideration.</p>

<p>I would also call attention to his ingenious and philosophical
explanation of the repugnance to marriage between
near relatives which is so very general both among savage
and civilised man, and as to the causes of which there
has been great diversity of opinion; and to his valuable suggestions
on the general question of sexual selection, in which
he furnishes an original argument against Darwin’s views on
the point, differing somewhat from my own though in general
harmony with it.</p>

<p>Every reader of the work will admire its clearness of style,
and the wonderful command of what is to the author a
foreign language.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p>I need scarcely say how fully I appreciate the honour
of being introduced to English readers by Mr. Alfred
R. Wallace. I am also greatly obliged for his kindness
in reading the proofs, and in giving me the benefit of his
advice with regard to various parts of the subject.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to acknowledge sufficiently my obligations
to Mr. James Sime for his assistance in preparing
this book for the press. The work, as originally written,
naturally contained a good many foreign modes of expression.
Mr. Sime has been indefatigable in helping me to improve
the form of the text; and, in our discussions on the main
lines of the argument, he has made several important
suggestions. I am sincerely obliged for the invaluable aid
he has given me.</p>

<p>My cordial thanks are due to Mr. Charles J. Cooke,
British Vice-Consul at Helsingfors, who most kindly aided
me in writing the first part of the book in a tongue which
is not my own. I am indebted also to Dr. E. B. Tylor,
Professor G. Croom Robertson, Mr. James Sully, and Dr.
W. C. Coupland for much encouraging interest; to Mr.
Joseph Jacobs for the readiness with which he has placed
at my disposal some results of his own researches; and to
several gentlemen in different parts of the world who have
been so good as to respond to my inquiries as to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
personal observation of various classes of phenomena connected
with marriage among savage tribes. The information
I have received from them is acknowledged in the passages
in which it is used.</p>

<p>A list of authorities is given at the end of the book—between
the text and the index, and it may be well to add
that the references in the notes have been carefully verified.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>In this new edition of my book I have made no essential
changes, but here and there the argument has been
strengthened by the addition of facts which have come
to my knowledge since the appearance of the first edition.
The most important of these new facts will be found in the
second chapter.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of expressing my warm appreciation
of the thorough way in which the ideas set forth in this
book have been discussed by many critics in England and
elsewhere. Translations of the work have appeared, or
are about to appear, in German, Swedish, French, Italian,
and Russian.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_THIRD_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h2>


<p>I much regret that the demand for a new edition of this
book should come at a time when circumstances prevent me
from undertaking such a revision of the work as I feel to be
required. Since the appearance of the Second Edition many
important facts bearing upon the subject have been brought
to light, new theories have been advanced, and old theories,
supported by fresh arguments, have been revived. To all
this, however, I can do no justice, as I am at present being
engaged in anthropological research in Morocco. This
edition is, in consequence, a mere reprint of the second.
But I purpose, after my return to Europe, to issue an
Appendix, in which the book will be brought more up to
date and some criticism will be replied to.</p>

HISTORY OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a><br />

<small>ON THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION</small></h2>


<p>It is in the firm conviction that the history of human
civilization should be made an object of as scientific a
treatment as the history of organic nature that I write this
book. Like the phenomena of physical and psychical life
those of social life should be classified into certain groups,
and each group investigated with regard to its origin and
development. Only when treated in this way can history
lay claim to the rank and honour of a science in the highest
sense of the term, as forming an important part of Sociology
the youngest of the principal branches of learning.</p>

<p>Descriptive historiography has no higher object than that of
offering materials to this science. It can, however, but very
inadequately fulfil this task. The written evidences of history
do not reach far into antiquity. They give us information
about times when the scale of civilization was already comparatively
high—but scarcely anything more. As to the origin and
early development of social institutions, they leave us entirely
in the dark. The sociologist cannot rest content with this. But
the information which historical documents are unable to afford
him, may be, to a great extent, obtained from ethnography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>The admirable works of Dr. Tylor, Sir John Lubbock, and
Mr. Herbert Spencer have already made us familiar with the
idea of a history of primitive civilization, based on ethnographical
grounds. This new manner of treating history has,
since the publication of their writings on the subject, gained
adherents day by day. Immeasurable expanses have thus
been opened to our knowledge, and many important results
have been reached. But it must, on the other hand, be admitted
that the scientific value of the conclusions drawn from
ethnographical facts has not always been adequate to the
labour, thought, and acumen bestowed on them. The various
investigators have, in many important questions, come to
results so widely different, that the possibility of thus getting
any information about the past might easily be doubted.
These differences, however, seem to me to be due, not to the
material, but to the manner of treating it.</p>

<p>“The chief sources of information regarding the early history
of civil society,” says Mr. McLennan, “are, first, the study of
races in their primitive condition; and, second, the study of the
symbols employed by advanced nations in the constitution or
exercise of civil rights.”<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Yet nothing has been more fatal to the Science of Society
than the habit of inferring, without sufficient reasons, from the
prevalence of a custom or institution among some savage
peoples, that this custom, this institution is a relic of a stage
of development that the whole human race once went through.
Thus the assumption that primitive men lived in tribes or
hordes, all the men of which had promiscuous intercourse with
all the women, where no individual marriage existed, and the
children were the common property of the tribe, is founded,
in the first place, on the statements of some travellers and
ancient writers as to peoples among whom this custom is said
actually to prevail, or to have prevailed. Dr. Post has gone
still further in his book, ‘Die Geschlechtsgenossenschaft der
Urzeit und die Entstehung der Ehe.’ Without adducing any
satisfactory reason for his opinion, he considers it probable
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> “monogamous marriage originally emerged everywhere
from pure communism in women, through the intermediate
stages of limited communism in women, polyandry, and
polygyny.”<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Mr. Lewis H. Morgan, in his ‘Systems of Consanguinity
and Affinity of the Human Family,’ has suggested
no fewer than fifteen normal stages in the evolution of
marriage and the family, assuming the existence and general
prevalence of a series of customs and institutions “which must
of necessity have preceded a knowledge of marriage between
single pairs, and of the family itself, in the modern sense of
the term.”<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> According to him, one of the first stages in this
series is the intermarriage of brothers and sisters, as evidence
of which he adduces, besides other facts, the historical statements
that one of the Herods was married to his sister, and
Cleopatra was married to her brother.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Again, in the study of symbols, or survivals, the sociologists
have by no means always been so careful as the
matter requires. True enough that “wherever we discover
symbolical forms, we are justified in inferring that in the
past life of the people employing them, there were corresponding
realities.”<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> But all depends upon our rightly interpreting
these symbols, and not putting into them a foreign
meaning. The worst is, however, that many customs have
been looked upon as survivals that probably are not so.
Thus, for instance, I think that Mr. McLennan is mistaken
in considering the system of the Levirate, under which, at a
man’s death, his wife or wives pass to his brother, as a test of
the former presence of polyandry, the brothers of a family
having a common wife.</p>

<p>Similar conclusions being of common occurrence in modern
Sociology, it is not surprising that different writers dissent
so frequently from each other. This should be a strong
reason for every conscientious investigator first of all putting
to himself the question: how can we from ethnographical facts
acquire information regarding the early history of mankind?</p>

<p>I do not think that this question can be correctly answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
in more than one way. We have first to find out the causes
of the social phenomena; then, from the prevalence of the
causes, we may infer the prevalence of the phenomena themselves,
if the former must be assumed to have operated
without being checked by other causes.</p>

<p>If, then, historical researches based on ethnography are to
be crowned with success, the first condition is that there shall
be a rich material. It is only by comparing a large number of
facts that we may hope to find the cause or causes on which a
social phenomenon is dependent. And a rich material is all
the more indispensable, as the trustworthiness of ethnographical
statements is not always beyond dispute. Without a
thorough knowledge of a people it is impossible to give an
exact account of its habits and customs, and therefore it often
happens that the statements of a traveller cannot, as regards
trustworthiness, come up to the evidences of history. As the
sociologist is in many cases unable to distinguish falsehood
from truth, he must be prepared to admit the inaccuracy of
some of the statements he quotes. What is wanting in quality
must be made up for in quantity; and he who does not give
himself the trouble to read through a voluminous literature
of ethnography should never enter into speculations on the
origin and early development of human civilization.</p>

<p>Often, no doubt, it is extremely difficult to make out the
causes of social phenomena. There are, for instance, among
savage peoples many customs which it seems almost impossible
to explain. Still, the statistical ‘method of investigating the
development of institutions,’ admirably set forth in the paper
which Dr. Tylor recently read before ‘The Anthropological
Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,’<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> will throw light upon
many mysterious points. Dr. Tylor has there shown that
causal relations among social facts may be discovered by way
of tabulation and classification. The particular rules of the
different peoples are to be scheduled out into tables, so as to
indicate the “adhesions,” or relations of coexistence of each
custom, showing which peoples have the same custom, and
what other customs accompany it or lie apart from it. If, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
starting with any two customs, the number of their “adhesions”
is found to be much greater than the number of times
they would coexist according to the ordinary law of chance-distribution—which
number is calculated from the total
number of peoples classified and the number of occurrences
of each custom—we may infer that there is some causal connection
between the two customs. Further on, I shall mention
some few of the inferences Dr. Tylor has already drawn by
means of this method.</p>

<p>The causes on which social phenomena are dependent fall
within the domain of different sciences—Biology, Psychology,
or Sociology. The reader will find that I put particular stress
upon the psychological causes, which have often been deplorably
overlooked, or only imperfectly touched upon. And
more especially do I believe that the mere instincts have
played a very important part in the origin of social institutions
and rules.</p>

<p>We could not, however, by following the method of investigation
here set forth, form any idea of the earlier stages of
human development, unless we had <i>some</i> previous knowledge
of the antiquity of mankind. Otherwise we should, of course,
be quite ignorant whether the causes in question operated or
not in the past. Fortunately, in this respect also, modern
science has come to results which scarcely admit any longer
of being considered as mere hypotheses. It teaches us, to
quote Sir John Lubbock, “that man was at first a mere
savage, and that the course of history has on the whole
been a progress towards civilization, though at times—and
at some times for centuries—some races have been
stationary, or even have retrograded;”<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> that, however, all
savage nations now existing are raised high above primitive
men; and that the first beings worthy to be called men, were
probably the gradually transformed descendants of some ape-like
ancestor. We may, further, take for granted that all the
physical and psychical qualities that man, in his present
state, has in common with his nearest relatives among the
lower animals, also occurred at the earlier stages of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
civilization. These conclusions open to us a rich source of
new knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, as to social survivals, I agree, certainly, with
Mr. McLennan that they are of great importance to Sociology.
But we must be extremely careful not to regard as
rudiments customs which may be more satisfactorily explained
otherwise.</p>

<p>It is only by strictly keeping to these principles that we may
hope to derive information touching the early history of man.
In doing so, the student will be on his guard against rash
conclusions. Considering that he has to make out the primary
sources of social phenomena before writing their history, he
will avoid assuming a custom to be primitive, only because,
at the first glance, it appears so; he will avoid making rules
of exceptions, and constructing the history of human development
on the immediate ground of isolated facts. It is true
that the critical sociologist, on account of the deficiency of
our knowledge, very often has to be content with hypotheses
and doubtful presumptions. At any rate, the interests of
science are better looked to, if we readily acknowledge our
ignorance, than if we pass off vague guesses as established
truths.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is one of the simplest of all social institutions the history
of which forms the subject of this book. Indeed, next to the
family consisting of mother and offspring only, marriage is
probably <i>the</i> simplest. I shall not, however, treat this subject
in all its aspects, but confine myself to human marriage,
though before dealing with it I must, of course, touch upon
the sexual relations of the lower animals also.</p>

<p>The expression “human marriage” will probably be
regarded by most people as an improper tautology. But,
as we shall see, marriage, in the natural history sense of the
term, does not belong exclusively to our own species. No
more fundamental difference between man and other animals
should be implied in sociological than in biological and psychological
terminology. Arbitrary classifications do science much
injury.</p>

<p>I shall examine human marriage from its different sides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
giving, in accordance with my method, an historical account
of each separately. The reader may find much that will outrage
his feelings, and, possibly, hurt his sense of modesty;
but the concealment of truth is the only indecorum known
to science. To keep anything secret within its cold and
passionless expanses, would be the same as to throw a cloth
round a naked statue.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

<small>THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE</small></h2>


<p>From remote antiquity we are told of kings and rulers
who instituted marriage amongst their subjects. We read in
‘Mahâbhârata,’ the Indian poem, that formerly “women were
unconfined, and roved about at their pleasure, independent.
Though in their youthful innocence, they went astray from
their husbands, they were guilty of no offence; for such was
the rule in early times.” But Swêtakêtu, son of the Rishi
Uddâlaka, could not bear this custom, and established the
rule that thenceforward wives should remain faithful to their
husbands and husbands to their wives.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The Chinese annals
recount that, “in the beginning, men differed in nothing from
other animals in their way of life. As they wandered up and
down in the woods, and women were in common, it happened
that children never knew their fathers, but only their mothers.”
The Emperor Fou-hi abolished, however, this indiscriminate
intercourse of the sexes and instituted marriage.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Again, the
ancient Egyptians are stated to be indebted to Menes for this
institution,<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and the Greeks to Kekrops. Originally, it is said,
they had no idea of conjugal union; they gratified their
desires promiscuously, and the children that sprang from
these irregular connections always bore the mother’s name.
But Kekrops showed the Athenians the inconvenience to
society from such an abuse, and established the laws and rules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The remote Laplanders, also, sing about Njavvis
and Attjis, who instituted marriage, and bound their wives by
sacred oaths.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Popular imagination prefers the clear and concrete; it
does not recognize any abstract laws that rule the universe.
Nothing exists without a cause, but this cause is not sought
in an agglomeration of external or internal forces; it is taken
to be simple and palpable, a personal being, a god or a king.
Is it not natural, then, that marriage, which plays such an
important part in the life of the individual, as well as in that
of the people, should be ascribed to a wise and powerful ruler,
or to direct divine intervention?</p>

<p>With notions of this kind science has nothing to do. If we
want to find out the origin of marriage, we have to strike into
another path, the only one which can lead to the truth, but a
path which is open to him alone who regards organic nature
as one continued chain, the last and most perfect link of which
is man. For we can no more stop within the limits of our
own species, when trying to find the root of our psychical and
social life, than we can understand the physical condition of
the human race without taking into consideration that of the
lower animals. I must, therefore, beg the reader to follow me
into a domain which many may consider out of the way, but
which we must, of necessity, explore in order to discover what
we seek.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the preservation of the progeny of the
lowest animals depends mainly upon chance. In the great
sub-kingdom of the Invertebrata, even the mothers are
exempted from nearly all anxiety as regards their offspring.
In the highest order, the Insects, the eggs are hatched by the
heat of the sun, and the mother, in most cases, does not even
see her young. Her care is generally limited to seeking out
an appropriate place for laying the eggs, and to fastening
them to some proper object and covering them, if this be
necessary for their preservation. Again, to the male’s share
nothing falls but the function of propagation.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>In the lowest classes of the Vertebrata, parental care is
likewise almost unheard of. In the immense majority of
species, young fishes are hatched without the assistance of
their parents, and have, from the outset, to help themselves.
Many Teleostei form, however, an exception; and, curiously
enough, it is the male on which, in these cases, the parental
duty generally devolves. In some instances he constructs a
nest, and jealously guards the ova deposited in it by the
female; while the male of certain species of Arius carries the
ova about with him in his capacious pharynx.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Most of the
Reptiles place their eggs in a convenient and sunny spot
between moss and leaves, and take no further trouble about
them. But several of the larger serpents have a curious
fashion of laying them in a heap, and then coiling themselves
around them in a great hollow cone.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> And female Crocodiles,
as also certain aquatic snakes of Cochin China, observed by
Dr. Morice, carry with them even their young.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Among the lower Vertebrata it rarely happens that both
parents jointly take care of their progeny. M. Milne Edwards
states, indeed, that in the Pipa, or Toad of Surinam, the male
helps the female to disburthen herself of her eggs;<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and the
Chelonia are known to live in pairs. “La femelle,” says
M. Espinas, “vient sur les plages sablonneuses au moment de
la ponte, accompagnée du mâle, et construit un nid en forme
de four où la chaleur du soleil fait éclore les œufs.”<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> But it
may be regarded as an almost universal rule that the relations
of the sexes are utterly fickle. The male and female come
together in the paring time; but having satisfied their sexual
instincts they part again, and have nothing more to do with
one another.</p>

<p>The Chelonia form, with regard to their domestic habits, a
transition to the Birds, as they do also from a zoological and,
particularly, from an embryological point of view. In the latter
class, parental affection has reached a very high degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
development, not only on the mother’s side, but also on the
father’s. Male and female help each other to build the nest,
the former generally bringing the materials, the latter doing
the work. In fulfilling the numberless duties of the breeding
season, both birds take a share. Incubation rests principally
with the mother, but the father, as a rule, helps his companion,
taking her place when she wants to leave the nest for a
moment, or providing her with food and protecting her from
every danger. Finally, when the duties of the breeding season
are over, and the result desired is obtained, a period with new
duties commences. During the first few days after hatching,
most birds rarely leave their young for long, and then only to
procure food for themselves and their family. In cases of
great danger, both parents bravely defend their offspring. As
soon as the first period of helplessness is over, and the young
have grown somewhat, they are carefully taught to shift for
themselves; and it is only when they are perfectly capable of
so doing that they leave the nest and the parents.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, a few birds that from the first day of
their ultra-oval existence lack all parental care; and in some
species, as the ducks, it frequently happens that the male leaves
family duties wholly to the female. But, as a general rule, both
share prosperity and adversity. The hatching of the eggs and
the chief part of the rearing duties belong to the mother,<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
whilst the father acts as protector, and provides food, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The relations of the sexes are thus of a very intimate
character, male and female keeping together not only during
the breeding season, but also after it. Nay, most birds, with
the exception of those belonging to the Gallinaceous family,
when pairing, do so once for all till either one or the other
dies. And Dr. Brehm is so filled with admiration for their
exemplary family life, that he enthusiastically declares
that “real genuine marriage can only be found among
birds.”<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>This certainly cannot be said of most of the Mammals. The
mother is, indeed, very ardently concerned for the welfare of
her young, generally nursing them with the utmost affection,
but this is by no means the case with the father. There are
cases in which he acts as an enemy of his own progeny. But
there are not wanting instances to the contrary, the connections
between the sexes, though generally restricted to the
time of the rut, being, with several species of a more durable
character. This is the case with whales,<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> seals,<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> the hippopotamus,<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
the <i>Cervus campestris</i>,<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> gazelles,<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> the <i>Neotragus Hemprichii</i>
and other small antelopes,<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> reindeer,<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> the <i>Hydromus
coypus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> squirrels,<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> moles,<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> the ichneumon,<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and some carnivorous
animals, as a few cats and martens,<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the yaguarundi in
South America,<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> the <i>Canis Brasiliensis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and possibly also the
wolf.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Among all these animals the sexes remain together
even after the birth of the young, the male being the protector
of the family.</p>

<p>What among lower Mammals is an exception, is among the
Quadrumana a rule. The natives of Madagascar relate that
in some species of the Prosimii, male and female nurse their
young in common<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>—a statement, however, which has not yet
been proved to be true. The mirikina (<i>Nyctipithecus trivirgatus</i>)
seems, according to Rengger, to live in pairs throughout
the whole year, for, whatever the season, a male and a female
are always found together.<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Of the <i>Mycetes Caraya</i>, <i>Cebus
Azarae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and <i>Ateles paniscus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> single individuals are very
seldom, or never, seen, whole families being generally met
with. Among the Arctopitheci,<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> the male parent is expressly
said to assist the female in taking care of the young ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>The most interesting to us are, of course, the man-like apes.
Diard was told by the Malays, and he found it afterwards to
be true, that the young Siamangs, when in their helpless state,
are carried about by their parents, the males by the father,
the females by the mother.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Lieutenant C. de Crespigny,
who was wandering in the northern part of Borneo in 1870,
gives the following description of the Orang-utan: “They
live in families—the male, female, and a young one. On one
occasion I found a family in which were two young ones, one
of them much larger than the other, and I took this as a proof
that the family tie had existed for at least two seasons. They
build commodious nests in the trees which form their feeding-ground,
and, so far as I could observe, the nests, which are
well lined with dry leaves, are only occupied by the female
and young, the male passing the night in the fork of the same
or another tree in the vicinity. The nests are very numerous
all over the forests, for they are not occupied above a few nights,
the mias (or Orang-utan) leading a roving life.”<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> According
to Dr. Mohnike, however, the old males generally live with the
females during the rutting season only;<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and Mr. Wallace
never saw two full-grown animals together. But as he sometimes
found not only females, but also males, accompanied by
half-grown young ones,<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> we may take for granted that the offspring
of the Orang-utan are not devoid of all paternal care.</p>

<p>More unanimous are the statements which we have regarding
the Gorilla. According to Dr. Savage, they live in bands,
and all his informants agree in the assertion that but one adult
male is seen in every band. “It is said that when the male
is first seen he gives a terrific yell that resounds far and wide
through the forest.... The females and young at the first
cry quickly disappear; he then approaches the enemy in great
fury, pouring out his horrid cries in quick succession.”<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Again,
Mr. Du Chaillu found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> “almost always one male with one female,
though sometimes the old male wanders companionless;”<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
and Mr. Winwood Reade states likewise that the Gorilla goes
“sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by his female and
young one.”<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The same traveller was told that, when a family
of Gorillas ascend a tree and eat a certain fruit, the old father
remains seated at the foot of the tree. And when the female
is pregnant, he builds a rude nest, usually about fifteen or
twenty feet from the ground; here she is delivered, and the
nest is then abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>For more recent information about the Gorilla we are indebted
to Herr von Koppenfells. He states that the male
spends the night crouching at the foot of the tree, against
which he places his back, and thus protects the female and
their young, which are in the nest above, from the nocturnal
attacks of leopards. Once he observed a male and female
with two young ones of different ages, the elder being perhaps
about six years old, the younger about one.<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>When all these statements are compared, it is impossible to
doubt that the Gorilla lives in families, the male parent being
in the habit of building the nest and protecting the family.
And the same is the case with the Chimpanzee. According
to Dr. Savage, “it is not unusual to see ‘the old folks’ sitting
under a tree regaling themselves with fruit and friendly chat,
while ‘their children’ are leaping around them and swinging
from branch to branch in boisterous merriment.”<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> And Herr
von Koppenfells assures us that the Chimpanzee, like the
Gorilla, builds a nest for the young and female on a forked
branch, the male himself spending the night lower down in
the tree.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Passing from the highest monkeys to the savage and barbarous
races of man, we meet with the same phenomenon.
With the exception of a few cases in which certain tribes are
asserted to live together promiscuously—almost all of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
assertions I shall prove further on to be groundless—travellers
unanimously agree that in the human race the relations of
the sexes are, as a rule, of a more or less durable character.
The family consisting of father, mother, and offspring, is a
universal institution, whether founded on a monogamous,
polygynous, or polyandrous marriage. And, as among the
lower animals having the same habit, it is to the mother that
the immediate care of the children chiefly belongs, while the
father is the protector and guardian of the family. Man in
the savage state is generally supposed to be rather indifferent
to the welfare of his wife and children, and this is really often
the case, especially if he be compared with civilized man.
But the simplest paternal duties are, nevertheless, universally
recognized. If he does nothing else, the father builds the
habitation, and employs himself in the chase and in war.</p>

<p>Thus, among the North American Indians, it was considered
disgraceful for a man to have more wives than he was able
to maintain.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Mr. Powers says that among the Patwin, a
Californian tribe which ranks among the lowest in the world,
“the sentiment that the men are bound to support the women—that
is to furnish the supplies—is stronger even than among
us.”<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Among the Iroquois it was the office of the husband
“to make a mat, to repair the cabin of his wife, or to construct
a new one.” The product of his hunting expeditions, during
the first year of marriage, belonged of right to his wife, and
afterwards he shared it equally with her, whether she remained
in the village, or accompanied him to the chase.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
Azara states that among the Charruas of South America,
“du moment où un homme se marie, il forme une famille à
part et travaille pour la nourrir;”<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> and among the Fuegians,
according to Admiral Fitzroy, “as soon as a youth is able to
maintain a wife, by his exertions in fishing or bird-catching,
he obtains the consent of her relations.”<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Again, among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
utterly rude Botocudos, whose girls are married very young,
remaining in the house of the father till the age of puberty,
the husband is even then obliged to maintain his wife, though
living apart from her.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>To judge from the recent account of Herr Lumholtz, the
paternal duties seemed to be scarcely recognized by the natives
of Queensland.<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> But with reference to the Kurnai in South
Australia, Mr. Howitt states that “the man has to provide for
his family with the assistance of his wife. His share is to
hunt for their support, and to fight for their protection.” As
a Kurnai once said to him, “A man hunts, spears fish, fights,
and sits about.”<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> And in the Encounter Bay tribe the
paternal care is considered so indispensable, that, if the father
dies before a child is born, the child is put to death by the
mother, as there is no longer any one to provide for it.<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Among the cannibals of New Britain, the chiefs have to see
that the families of the warriors are properly maintained.<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
As regards the Tonga Islanders, Martin remarks, “A married
woman is one who cohabits with a man, and lives under his
roof and protection;”<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and in Samoa, according to Mr.
Pritchard, “whatever intercourse may take place between the
sexes, a woman does not become a man’s wife unless the
latter take her to his own house.”<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Among the Maoris, says
Mr. Johnston, “the mission of woman was to increase and
multiply; that of man to defend his home.”<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> In Radack,
even natural children are received by the father into his
house, as soon as they are able to walk.<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>The Rev. D. Macdonald states that, in some African tribes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
“a father has to fast after the birth of his child, or take some
such method of showing that he recognizes that he as well as
the mother should take care of the young stranger.”<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Certain
Africans will not even go on any warlike expedition when
they have a young child;<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and the South American Guaranies,
while their wives are pregnant do not risk their lives in
hunting wild beasts.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> In Lado the bridegroom has to assure
his father-in-law three times that he will protect his wife,
calling the people present to witness.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> And among the
Touaregs, according to Dr. Chavanne, a man who deserts his
wife is blamed, as he has taken upon himself the obligation of
maintaining her.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>The wretched Rock Veddahs in Ceylon, according to Sir
J. Emerson Tennent, “acknowledge the marital obligation
and the duty of supporting their own families.”<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Among the
Maldivians, “although a man is allowed four wives at one
time, it is only on condition of his being able to support
them.”<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> The Nagas are not permitted to marry until they
are able to set up house on their own account.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> The Nairs,
we are told, consider it a husband’s duty to provide his wife
with food, clothing, and ornaments;<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and almost the same is
said by Dr. Schwaner with reference to the tribes of the
Barito district, in the south-east part of Borneo.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> A Burmese
woman can demand a divorce, if her husband is not able to
maintain her properly.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Among the Mohammedans, the
maintenance of the children devolves so exclusively on the
father, that the mother is even entitled to claim wages for
nursing them.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> And among the Romans, <i>manus</i> implied not
only the wife’s subordination to the husband, but also the
husband’s obligation to protect the wife.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>The father’s place in the family being that of a supporter
and protector, a man is often not permitted to marry until he
has given some proof of his ability to fulfil these duties.</p>

<p>The Koyúkuns believe that a youth who marries before he
has killed a deer will have no children.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The aborigines of
Pennsylvania considered it a shame for a boy to think of
a wife before having given some proof of his manhood.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
Among the wild Indians of British Guiana, says Mr. Im
Thurn, before a man is allowed to choose a wife he must
prove that he can do a man’s work and is able to support
himself and his family.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Among the Dyaks of Borneo,<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> the
Nagas of Upper Assam,<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> and the Alfura of Ceram,<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> no one
can marry unless he has in his possession a certain number of
heads. The Karmanians, according to Strabo, were considered
marriageable only after having killed an enemy.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> The
desire of a Galla warrior is to deprive the enemy of his
genitals, the possession of such a trophy being a necessary
preliminary to marriage.<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Among the Bechuana and Kafir
tribes south of the Zambesi, the youth is not allowed to take
a wife until he has killed a rhinoceros.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> In the Marianne
Group, the suitor had to give proof of his bodily strength and
skill.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> And among the Arabs of Upper Egypt, the man must
undergo an ordeal of whipping by the relations of his bride
in order to test his courage. If he wishes to be considered
worth having, he must receive the chastisement, which is sometimes
exceedingly severe, with an expression of enjoyment.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>The idea that a man is bound to maintain his family is,
indeed, so closely connected with that of marriage and father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>hood,
that sometimes even repudiated wives with their children
are, at least to a certain extent, supported by their former
husbands. This is the case among the Chukchi of North-Western
Asia,<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> the Basutos in Southern Africa,<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and the
Munda Kols in Chota Nagpore.<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Further, a wife frequently
enjoys her husband’s protection even after sexual relations
have been broken off. And upon his death, the obligation of
maintaining her and her children devolves on his heirs, the
wide-spread custom of a man marrying the widow of his
deceased brother being, as we shall see in a subsequent
chapter, not only a privilege belonging to the man, but, among
several peoples, even a duty. We may thus take for granted
that in the human race, at least at its present stage, the father
has to perform the same function as in other animal species,
where the connections between the sexes last longer than the
sexual desire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In encyclopedical and philosophical works we meet with
several different definitions of the word marriage. Most of
these definitions are, however, of a merely juridical or ethical
nature, comprehending either what is required to make the
union legal,<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> or what, in the eye of an idealist, the union
ought to be.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> But it is scarcely necessary to say how far I
am here from using the word in either of these senses. It is
the natural history of human marriage that is the object of
this treatise; and, from a scientific point of view, I think there
is but one definition which may claim to be generally admitted,
that, namely, according to which marriage is nothing
else than a more or less durable connection between male and
female, lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the birth of the offspring. This definition is wide enough to
include all others hitherto given, and narrow enough to exclude
those wholly loose connections which by usage are never
honoured with the name of marriage. It implies not only
sexual relations, but also living together, as is set forth in
the proverb of the Middle Ages, “Boire, manger, coucher
ensemble est mariage, ce me semble.”<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> And, though, rather
vague, which is a matter of course, it has the advantage of
comprehending in one notion phenomena essentially similar
and having a common origin.</p>

<p>Thus, as appears from the preceding investigation, the first
traces of marriage are found among the Chelonia. With the
Birds it is an almost universal institution, whilst, among the
Mammals, it is restricted to certain species only. We observed,
however, that it occurs, as a rule, among the monkeys,
especially the anthropomorphous apes as well as in the races
of men. Is it probable, then, that marriage was transmitted
to man from some ape-like ancestor, and that there never was
a time when it did not occur in the human race? These
questions cannot be answered before we have found out the
cause to which it owes its origin.</p>

<p>It is obvious that where the generative power is restricted
to a certain season, it cannot be the sexual instinct that keeps
male and female together for months or years. Nor is there
any other egoistic motive that could probably account for
this habit. Considering that the union lasts till after the
birth of the offspring, and considering the care taken of this
by the father, we may assume that the prolonged union of the
sexes is, in some way or other connected with parental duties.
I am, indeed, strongly of opinion that the tie which joins
male and female is an instinct developed through the powerful
influence of natural selection. It is evident that, when the
father helps to protect the offspring, the species is better able
to subsist in the struggle for existence than it would be if this
obligation entirely devolved on the mother. Paternal affection
and the instinct which causes male and female to form somewhat
durable alliances, are thus useful mental dispositions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
which, in all probability, have been acquired through the
survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>But how, then, can it be that among most animals the
father never concerns himself about his progeny? The answer
is not difficult to find. Marriage is only one of many means
by which a species is enabled to subsist. Where parental
care is lacking, we may be sure to find compensation for it
in some other way. Among the Invertebrata, Fishes, and
Reptiles, both parents are generally quite indifferent as to
their progeny. An immense proportion of the progeny therefore
succumb before reaching maturity; but the number of
eggs laid is proportionate to the number of those lost, and the
species is preserved nevertheless. If every grain of roe,
spawned by the female fishes, were fecundated and hatched,
the sea would not be large enough to hold all the creatures
resulting from them. The eggs of Reptiles need no maternal
care, the embryo being developed by the heat of the sun; and
their young are from the outset able to help themselves,
leading the same life as the adults. Among Birds, on the
other hand, parental care is an absolute necessity. Equal
and continual warmth is the first requirement for the development
of the embryo and the preservation of the young ones.
For this the mother almost always wants the assistance of the
father, who provides her with necessaries, and sometimes
relieves her of the brooding. Among Mammals, the young
can never do without the mother at the tenderest age, but the
father’s aid is generally by no means indispensable. In some
species, as the walrus,<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> the elephant,<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> the <i>Bos americanus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> and
the bat,<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> there seems to be a rather curious substitute for
paternal protection, the females, together with their young
ones, collecting in large herds or flocks apart from the males.
Again, as to the marriage of the Primates, it is, I think, very
probably due to the small number of young, the female
bringing forth but one at a time; and, among the highest
apes, as in man, also to the long period of infancy.<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
too, the defective family life of the Orang-utan, compared
with that of the Gorilla and Chimpanzee, depends upon the
fewer dangers to which this animal is exposed. For “except
man,” Dr. Mohnike says, “the Orang-utan in Borneo has no
enemy of equal strength.”<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> In short, the factors which the
existence of a species depends upon, as the number of the
progeny, their ability to help themselves when young, maternal
care, marriage, &amp;c., vary indefinitely in different species.
But in those that do not succumb, all these factors are more
or less proportionate to each other, the product always being
the maintenance of the species.</p>

<p>Marriage and family are thus intimately connected with
each other: it is for the benefit of the young that male and
female continue to live together. Marriage is therefore rooted
in family, rather than family in marriage. There are also
many peoples among whom true conjugal life does not begin
before a child is born, and others who consider that the birth
of a child out of wedlock makes it obligatory for the parents
to marry. Among the Eastern Greenlanders<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> and the
Fuegians,<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> marriage is not regarded as complete till the
woman has become a mother. Among the Shawanese<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> and
Abipones,<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> the wife very often remains at her father’s house
till she has a child. Among the Khyens, the Ainos of
Yesso, and one of the aboriginal tribes of China, the husband
goes to live with his wife at her father’s house, and never
takes her away till after the birth of a child.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> In Circassia,
the bride and bridegroom are kept apart until the first child
is born;<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and among the Bedouins of Mount Sinai, a wife
never enters her husband’s tent until she becomes far advanced
in pregnancy.<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Among the Baele, the wife remains with her
parents until she becomes a mother, and if this does not happen,
she stays there for ever, the husband getting back what he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
paid for her.<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> In Siam, a wife does not receive her marriage
portion before having given birth to a child;<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> while among
the Atkha Aleuts, according to Erman, a husband does not
pay the purchase sum before he has become a father.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Again,
the Badagas in Southern India have two marriage ceremonies,
the second of which does not take place till there is some indication
that the pair are to have a family; and if there is no
appearance of this, the couple not uncommonly separate.<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
Dr. Bérenger-Féraud states that, among the Wolofs in Senegambia,
“ce n’est que lorsque les signes de la grossesse
sont irrécusables chez la fiancée, quelquefois même ce n’est
qu’après la naissance d’un ou plusieurs enfants, que la cérémonie
du mariage proprement dit s’accomplit.”<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> And the
Igorrotes of Luzon consider no engagement binding until the
woman has become pregnant.<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Emin Pasha tells us that, among the
Mádi in Central Africa, “should a girl become pregnant, the
youth who has been her companion is bound to marry her,
and to pay to her father the customary price of a bride.”<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
Burton reports a similar custom as prevailing among peoples
dwelling to the south of the equator.<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Among many of the
wild tribes of Borneo, there is almost unrestrained intercourse
between the youth of both sexes; but, if pregnancy
ensue, marriage is regarded as necessary.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> The same, as I am
informed by Dr. A. Bunker, is the case with some Karen tribes
in Burma. In Tahiti, according to Cook, the father might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
kill his natural child, but if he suffered it to live, the parties
were considered to be in the married state.<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Among the
Tipperahs of the Chittagong Hills,<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> as well as the peasants of
the Ukraine,<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> a seducer is bound to marry the girl, should she
become pregnant. Again, Mr.Powers informs us that, among
the Californian Wintun, if a wife is abandoned when she has
a young child, she is justified by her friends in destroying
it on the ground that it has no supporter.<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> And among the
Creeks, a young woman that becomes pregnant by a man
whom she had expected to marry, and is disappointed, is
allowed the same privilege.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>It might, however, be supposed that, in man, the prolonged
union of the sexes is due to another cause besides the
offspring’s want of parental care, <i>i.e.</i>, to the fact that the
sexual instinct is not restricted to any particular season, but
endures throughout the whole year. “That which distinguishes
man from the beast,” Beaumarchais says, “is drinking without
being thirsty, and making love at all seasons.” But in the
next chapter, I shall endeavour to show that this is probably
not quite correct, so far as our earliest human or semi-human
ancestors are concerned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<small>A HUMAN PAIRING SEASON IN PRIMITIVE TIMES</small></h2>


<p>Professor Leuckart assumes that the periodicity in the
sexual life of animals depends upon economical conditions, the
reproductive matter being a surplus of the individual economy.
Hence he says that the rut occurs at the time when the proportion
between receipts and expenditure is most favourable.<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>Though this hypothesis is accepted by several eminent physiologists,
facts do not support the assumption that the power
of reproduction is correlated with abundance of food and
bodily vigour. There are some writers who even believe that
the reverse is the case.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>At any rate, it is not correct to say, with Dr. Gruenhagen,
that “the general wedding-feast is spring, when awakening
nature opens, to most animals, new and ample sources of
living.”<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> This is certainly true of Reptiles and Birds, but
not of Mammals; every month or season of the year is the
pairing season of one or another mammalian species.<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
notwithstanding this apparent irregularity, the pairing time
of every species is bound by an unfailing law; it sets in
earlier or later, according as the period of gestation lasts
longer or shorter, so that the young may be born at the
time when they are most likely to survive. Thus, most
Mammals bring forth their young early in spring, or, in
tropical countries, at the beginning of the rainy season; the
period then commences when life is more easily sustained,
when prey is most abundant, when there is enough water
and vegetable food, and when the climate becomes warmer.
In the highlands, animals pair later than those living in lower
regions,<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> whilst those of the polar and temperate zones
generally pair later than those of the tropics. As regards
the species living in different latitudes the pairing time comes
earlier or later, according to the differences in climate.<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>Far from depending upon any general physiological law,
the rut is thus adapted to the requirements of each species
separately. Here again we have an example of the powerful
effects of natural selection, often showing themselves very
obviously. The dormouse (<i>Muscardinus avellanarius</i>), for instance,
that feeds upon hazel-nuts, pairs in July, and brings
forth its young in August, when nuts begin to ripen. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the young grow very quickly, so that they are able to bear
the autumn and winter cold.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>There are, however, a few wild species, as some whales,<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
the elephant,<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> many Rodents,<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> and several of the lower
monkeys,<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> that seem to have no definite pairing season. As
to them it is, perhaps, sufficient to quote Dr. Brehm’s statement
with reference to the elephant, “The richness of their
woods is so great, that they really never suffer want.”<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> But
the man-like apes do not belong to this class. According to
Mr. Winwood Reade, the male Gorillas fight at the rutting
season for their females;<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Dr. Mohnike, as also other
authorities, mentions the occurrence of a rut-time with the
Orang-utan.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> And we find that both of these species breed
early in the season when fruits begin to be plentiful,—that
is, their pairing time depends on the same law as that which
prevails in the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Burton says, “The Gorilla breeds about
December, a cool and dry month; according to my bushmen,
the period of gestation is between five and six months.”<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> I
have referred this important statement to Mr. Alfred R. Wallace,
who writes as follows: “From the maps of rain distribution
in Africa in Stanford’s ‘Compendium,’ the driest months
in the Gorilla country seem to be January and February,
and these would probably be the months of greatest fruit
supply.” As regards the Orang-utan, Mr. Wallace adds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> “I
found the young sucking Orang-utan in May; that was
about the second or third month of the dry season, in which
fruits began to be plentiful.”</p>

<p>Considering, then, that the periodicity of the sexual
life rests on the kind of food on which the species lives,
together with other circumstances connected with anatomical
and physiological peculiarities, and considering, further, the
close biological resemblance between man and the man-like
apes, we are almost compelled to assume that the pairing
time of our earliest human or half-human ancestors was
restricted to a certain season of the year, as was also the
case with their nearest relations among the lower animals.
This presumption derives further probability from there
being, even now, some rude peoples who are actually stated
to have an annual pairing time, and other peoples whose
sexual instinct undergoes most decidedly a periodical increase
at a certain time of the year.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Johnston, the wild Indians of California,
belonging to the lowest races on earth, “have their rutting
seasons as regularly as have the deer, the elk, the antelope, or
any other animals.”<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> And Mr. Powers confirms the correctness
of this statement, at least with regard to some of these
Indians, saying that spring “is a literal Saint Valentine’s
Day with them, as with the natural beasts and birds of the
forest.”<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>As regards the Goddanes in Luzon, Mr. Foreman tells us
that “it is the custom of the young men about to marry, to
vie with each other in presenting to the sires of their future
bride all the scalps they are able to take from their enemies,
as proof of their manliness and courage. This practice
prevails at the season of the year when the tree—popularly
called by the Spaniards ‘the fire-tree’—is in bloom.”<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Watch-an-dies in the western part of
Australia, Mr. Oldfield remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> “Like the beasts of the field,
the savage has but one time for copulation in the year.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> About
the middle of spring ... the Watch-an-dies begin to think
of holding their grand semi-religious festival of Caa-ro,
preparatory to the performance of the important duty of
procreation.”<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> A similar feast, according to Mr. Bonwick,
was celebrated by the Tasmanians at the same time of the
year.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>The Hos, an Indian hill tribe, have, as we are informed by
Colonel Dalton, every year a great feast in January, “when
the granaries are full of grain, and the people, to use their
own expression, full of devilry. They have a strange notion
that at this period, men and women are so over-charged with
vicious propensities, that it is absolutely necessary for the
safety of the person to let off steam by allowing for a time
full vent to the passions. The festival, therefore, becomes a
saturnalia, during which servants forget their duty to their
masters, children their reverence for parents, men their respect
for women, and women all notions of modesty, delicacy, and
gentleness.” Men and women become almost like animals in
the indulgence of their amorous propensities, and the utmost
liberty is given to the girls.<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>The same writer adds that “it would appear that most Hill
Tribes have found it necessary to promote marriage by stimulating
intercourse between the sexes at particular seasons of
the year.”<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Among the Santals, “the marriages mostly take
place once a year, in January; for six days all the candidates
for matrimony live in promiscuous concubinage, after which
the whole party are supposed to have paired off as man and
wife.”<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The Punjas in Jeypore, according to Dr. Shortt, have
a festival in the first month of the new year, where men and
women assemble. The lower order or castes observe this
festival, which is kept up for a month, by both sexes mixing
promiscuously, and taking partners as their choice directs.<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>
A similar feast, comprising a continuous course of debauchery
and licentiousness, is held once a year, by the Kotars, a tribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
inhabiting the Neilgherries;<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> according to Mr. Bancroft, by
the Keres in New Mexico;<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> according to Dr. Fritsch, by the
Hottentots;<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> according to the Rev. H. Rowley, by the
Kafirs;<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> and, as I am informed by Mr. A. J. Swann, by
some tribes near Nyassa. Writers of the sixteenth century
speak of the existence of certain early festivals in Russia,
at which great license prevailed. According to Pamphill, these
annual gatherings took place, as a rule, at the end of June,
the day before the festival of St. John the Baptist, which, in
pagan times, was that of a divinity known by the name of
Jarilo, corresponding to the Priapus of the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> At
Rome, a festival in honour of Venus took place in the month
of April;<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and Mannhardt mentions some curious popular
customs in Germany, England, Esthonia and other European
countries, which seem to indicate an increase of the sexual
instinct in spring or at the beginning of summer.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>By questions addressed to persons living among various
savage peoples, I have inquired whether among these peoples,
marriages are principally contracted at a certain time of the
year, and whether more children are born in one month or
season than in another. In answer, Mr. Radfield writes from
Lifu, near New Caledonia, that marriages there formerly took
place at various times, when suitable, but “November used to
be the time at which engagements were made.” As the
seasons in this island are the reverse of those in England, this
month includes the end of spring and the beginning of summer.
The Rev. H. T. Cousins informs me that, among the Kafirs
inhabiting what is known as Cis-Natalian Kafirland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> “there
are more children born in one month or season than in another,
<i>viz.</i> August and September, which are the spring months in
South Africa;” and he ascribes this surplus of births to feasts,
comprising debauchery and unrestricted intercourse between
the unmarried people of both sexes. Again, Dr. A. Sims
writes from Stanley Pool that, among the Bateke, more
children are born in September and October, that is, in the
seasons of the early rains, than at other times; and the Rev.
Ch. E. Ingham, writing from Banza Manteka, states that he
believes the same to be the case among the Bakongo. But
the Rev. T. Bridges informs me that, among the Yahgans in
the southern part of Tierra del Fuego, so far as he knows, one
month is the same as another with regard to the number of
births. I venture, however, to think that this result might be
somewhat modified by a minute inquiry, embracing a sufficient
number of cases. For statistics prove that even in civilized
countries, there is a regular periodical fluctuation in the
birth-rate.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century Wargentin showed that, in
Sweden more children were born in one month than in
another.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The same has since been found to be the case in
other European countries. According to Wappäus, the
number of births in Sardinia, Belgium, Holland, and Sweden
is subject to a regular increase twice a year, the maximum of
the first increase occurring in February or March, that of the
second in September and October.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> M. Sormani observed
that, in the south of Italy, there is an increase only once in
the year, but more to the north twice, in spring and in autumn.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
Dr. Mayr and Dr. Beukemann found in Germany two annual
maxima—in February or March, and in September;—<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>and
Dr. Haycraft states that, in the eight largest towns of
Scotland, more children are born in legitimate wedlock in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
April than in any other month.<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> As a rule, according to M.
Sormani, the first annual augmentation of births has its
maximum, in Sweden, in March; in France and Holland,
between February and March; in Belgium, Spain, Austria
and Italy, in February; in Greece, in January; so that it
comes earlier in southern Europe than farther to the north.<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
Again, the second annual increase is found more considerable
the more to the north we go. In South Germany it is smaller
than the first one, but in North Germany generally larger;<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
and in Sweden, it is decidedly larger.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>As to non-European countries, Wappäus observed that in
Massachusetts, the birth-rate likewise underwent an increase
twice a year, the maxima falling in March and September;
and that in Chili many more children were born in September
and October—<i>i.e.</i>, at the beginning of spring—than in any
other month.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> Finally, Mr. S. A. Hill, of Allahabad, has
proved, by statistical data, that, among the Hindus of that
province, the birth-rates exhibit a most distinct annual
variation, the minimum falling in June and the maximum
in September and October.<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>This unequal distribution of births over the different months
of the year is ascribed to various causes by statisticians. It
is, however, generally admitted that the maximum in February
and March (in Chili, September) is, at least to a great extent,
due to the sexual instinct being strongest in May and June
(in Chili, December).<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> This is the more likely to be the case
as it is especially illegitimate births that are then comparatively
numerous. And it appears extremely probable that, in Africa
also, the higher birth-rates in the seasons of the early rains
owe their origin to the same cause.</p>

<p>Thus, comparing the facts stated, we find, among various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
races of men, the sexual instinct increasing at the end of
spring, or, rather, at the beginning of summer. Some peoples
of India seem to form an exception to this rule, lascivious festivals,
in the case of several of them, taking place in the month
of January, and the maximum of births, among the Hindus of
Allahabad, falling at the end of the hot season, or in early
autumn. But in India also there are traces of strengthened
passions in spring. M. Rousselet gives the following description
of the indecent Holi festival, as it is celebrated among
the Hindus of Oudeypour. “The festival of Holi marks the
arrival of spring, and is held in honour of the goddess Holica,
or Vasanti, who personifies that season in the Hindu
Pantheon. The carnival lasts several days, during which
time the most licentious debauchery and disorder reign
throughout every class of society. It is the regular saturnalia
of India. Persons of the greatest respectability, without
regard to rank or age, are not ashamed to take part in the
orgies which mark this season of the year.... Women and
children crowd round the hideous idols of the feast of Holica,
and deck them with flowers; and immorality reigns supreme
in the streets of the capital.”<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> Among the Aryans who inhabited
the plains of the North, the spring, or “vasanta,”
corresponding to the months of March and April, was the
season of love and pleasure, celebrated in song by the poets,
and the time for marriages and religious feasts.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> And among
the Rajputs of Mewar, according to Lieutenant-Colonel Tod,
the last days of spring are dedicated to Camdéva, the god of
love: “the scorching winds of the hot season are already
beginning to blow, when Flora droops her head, and the ‘god
of love turns anchorite.’”<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>We must not, however, infer that this enhancement of the
procreative power is to be attributed directly to “the different
positions of the sun with respect to the earth,”<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> or to the
temperature of a certain season. The phenomenon does not
immediately spring from this cause in the case of any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
animal species. Neither can it be due to abundance of food.
In the northern parts of Europe many more conceptions take
place in the months of May and June, when the conditions of
life are often rather hard, than in September, October, and
November, when the supplies of food are comparatively
plentiful. In the north-western provinces of Germany, as
well as in Sweden, the latter months are characterized by a
minimum of conceptions.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Among the Kaffirs, more children
are conceived in November and December than in any other
month, although, according to the Rev. H. T. Cousins, food
is most abundant among them from March to September.
And among the Bateke, the maximum of conceptions falls
in December and January, although food is, as I am informed
by Dr. Sims, most plentiful in the dry season, that is, from
May to the end of August.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the periodical increase of conceptions
cannot be explained by the opposite hypothesis, entertained
by some physiologists, that the power of reproduction is increased
by want and distress. Among the Western Australians
and Californians,<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> for instance, the season of love is
accompanied by a surplus of food, and in the land of the
Bakongo, among whom Mr. Ingham believes most conceptions
to take place in December and January, food is, according
to him, most abundant precisely in these months and in
February.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, a reasonable presumption that the increase
of the sexual instinct at the end of spring or in the
beginning of summer, is a survival of an ancient pairing
season, depending upon the same law that rules in the rest
of the animal kingdom. Since spring is rather a time of
want than a time of abundance for a frugivorous species, it is
impossible to believe that our early ancestors, as long as they
fed upon fruits, gave birth to their young at the beginning of
that period. From the statements of Sir Richard Burton and
Mr. A. R. Wallace, already quoted,<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> we know that the man-like
apes breed early in the season when fruits begin to be
plentiful. But when man began to feed on herbs, roots, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
animal food, the conditions were changed. Spring is the season
of the re-awakening of life, when there are plenty of vegetables
and prey. Hence those children whose infancy fell in this
period survived more frequently than those born at any other.
Considering that the parents of at least a few of them must
have had an innate tendency to the increase of the power of
reproduction at the beginning of summer, and considering,
further, that this tendency must have been transmitted to
some of the offspring, like many other characteristics which
occur periodically at certain seasons,<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> we can readily understand
that gradually, through the influence of natural selection,
a race would emerge whose pairing time would be exclusively
or predominantly restricted to the season most favourable to
its subsistence. To judge from the period when most children
are born among existing peoples, the pairing season of our
prehistoric ancestors occurred, indeed, somewhat earlier in
the year than is the case with the majority of mammalian
species. But we must remember that the infancy of man is
unusually long; and, with regard to the time most favourable
to the subsistence of children, we must take into consideration
not only the first days of their existence, but the first period
of their infancy in general. Besides food and warmth, several
other factors affect the welfare of the offspring, and it is
often difficult to find out all of them. We do not know the
particular circumstances that make the badger breed at the
end of February or the beginning of March,<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> and the reindeer
of the Norwegian mountains as early as April;<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> but there can
be no doubt that these breeding seasons are adapted to the
requirements of the respective species.</p>

<p>The cause of the winter maximum of conceptions, especially
considerable among the peoples of Northern Europe, is generally
sought in social influences, as the quiet ensuing on the
harvest time, the better food, and the amusements of Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
But the people certainly recover before December
from the labours of the field, and Christmas amusements, as
Wargentin remarks, take place at the end of that month and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
far into January, without any particular influence upon the
number of births in October being observable.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> It has, further,
been proved that the unequal distribution of marriages over
the different months exercises hardly any influence upon the
distribution of births.<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> Again, among the Hindus the December
and January maximum of conceptions seems from the
lascivious festivities of several Indian peoples to be due to an
increase of the sexual instinct. According to Mr. Hill, this
increase depends upon healthy conditions with an abundant
food supply. But, as I have already said, it is not proved that
a strengthened power of reproduction and abundance of food
are connected with one another.</p>

<p>I am far from venturing to express any definite opinion as
to the cause of these particular phenomena, but it is not impossible
that they also are effects of natural selection, although of
a comparatively recent date. Considering that the September
maximum of births (or December maximum of conceptions)
in Europe becomes larger the farther north we go; that the
agricultural peoples of Northern Europe have plenty of food
in autumn and during the first part of winter, but often suffer
a certain degree of want in spring; and, finally, that the winter
cold does not affect the health of infants, the woods giving
sufficient material for fuel,—it has occurred to me that children
born in September may have a better chance of surviving
than others. Indeed, Dr. Beukemann states that the number
of still-born births is largest in winter or at the beginning of
spring, and that “the children born in autumn possess the
greatest vitality and resisting power against the dangers of
earliest infancy.”<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> This would perhaps be an adequate explanation
either of an increase of the sexual instinct or of greater
disposition to impregnation in December. It is not impossible
either, that the increase of the power of reproduction among
the Hindus in December and January, which causes an increase
of births in September and October—<i>i.e.</i>, the end of
the hot season and the beginning of winter—owes its origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to the fact that during the winter the granaries get filled and
some of the conditions of life become more healthy. But it
should be remarked that September itself, according to Mr.
Hill, is a very unhealthy month.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>Now it can be explained, I believe for the first time, how
it happens that man, unlike the lower animals, is not limited
to a particular period of the year in which to court the female.<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
The Darwinian theory of natural selection can, as it seems to
me, account for the periodicity of the sexual instinct in such
a rude race as the Western Australians, among whom the
mortality of children is so enormous that the greater number
of them do not survive even the first month after birth,<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> and
who inhabit a land pre-eminently unproductive of animals
and vegetables fitted to sustain human life, a land where,
“during the summer seasons, the black man riots in comparative
abundance, but during the rest of the year ...
the struggle for existence becomes very severe.”<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> The more
progress man makes in arts and inventions; the more he
acquires the power of resisting injurious external influences;
the more he rids himself of the necessity of freezing when it
is cold, and starving when nature is less lavish with food; in
short, the more independent he becomes of the changes of the
seasons—the greater is the probability that children born at
one time of the year will survive as well, or almost as well, as
those born at any other. Variations as regards the pairing
time, always likely to occur occasionally, will do so the more
frequently on account of changed conditions of life, which
directly or indirectly cause variability of every kind;<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and
these variations will be preserved and transmitted to following
generations. Thus we can understand how a race has arisen,
endowed with the ability to procreate children in any season.
We can also understand how, even in such a rude race as the
Yahgans in Tierra del Fuego, the seasonable distribution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
births seems to be pretty equal, as there is, according to the
Rev. T. Bridges, “such a variety of food in the various seasons
that there is strictly no period of hardship, save such as is
caused by accidents of weather.” We can explain, too, why
the periodical fluctuation in the number of births, though comparatively
inconsiderable in every civilized society, is greater
in countries predominantly agricultural, such as Chili, than
in countries predominantly industrial, as Saxony;<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> why it
is greater in rural districts than in towns;<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and why it was
greater in Sweden in the middle of the last century than it is
now.<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> For the more man has abandoned natural life out of
doors, the more luxury has increased and his habits have got
refined, the greater is the variability to which his sexual life
has become subject, and the smaller has been the influence
exerted upon it by the changes of the seasons.</p>

<p>Man has thus gone through the same transition as certain
domestic animals. The he-goat<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> and the ass in southern
countries,<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> for instance, rut throughout the whole year. The
domestic pig pairs generally twice a year, while its wild ancestors
had but one rutting season.<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Dr. Hermann Müller
has even observed a canary that laid eggs in autumn and
winter.<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> Natural selection cannot, of course, account for
such alterations: they fall under the law of variation. It is
the limited pairing season that is a product of this powerful
process, which acts with full force only under conditions free
from civilization and domestication.</p>

<p>If the hypothesis set forth in this chapter holds good, it
must be admitted that the continued excitement of the sexual
instinct could not have played a part in the origin of human
marriage—provided that this institution did exist among
primitive men. Whether this was the case I shall examine
in the following chapters.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<small>THE ANTIQUITY OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</small></h2>


<p>If it be admitted that marriage, as a necessary requirement
for the existence of certain species, is connected with some
peculiarities in their organism, and, more particularly among
the highest monkeys, with the paucity of their progeny and
their long period of infancy,—it must at the same time be
admitted that, among primitive men, from the same causes
as among these animals, the sexes in all probability kept
together till after the birth of the offspring. Later on, when
the human race passed beyond its frugivorous stage and
spread over the earth, living chiefly on animal food, the assistance
of an adult male became still more necessary for the
subsistence of the children. Everywhere the chase devolves
on the man, it being a rare exception among savage peoples
for a woman to engage in it.<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> Under such conditions a
family consisting of mother and young only, would probably,
as a rule, have succumbed.</p>

<p>It has, however, been suggested that, in olden times, the
natural guardian of the children was not the father, but the
maternal uncle.<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> This inference has been drawn chiefly from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
the common practice of a nephew succeeding his mother’s
brother in rank and property. But sometimes the relation
between the two is still more intimate. “La famille Malaise
proprement dite—le Sa-Mandei,—” says a Dutch writer, as
quoted by Professor Giraud-Teulon, “consiste dans la mère
et ses enfants: le père n’en fait point partie. Les liens de
parenté qui unissent ce dernier à ses frères et sœurs sont plus
étrois que ceux qui le rattachent à sa femme et à ses propres
enfants. Il continue même après son mariage à vivre dans
sa famille maternelle; c’est là qu’est son véritable domicile, et
non pas dans la maison de sa femme: il ne cesse pas de
cultiver le champ de sa propre famille, à travailler pour elle,
et n’aide sa femme qu’accidentellement. Le chef de la famille
est ordinairement le frère aîné du côté maternel (le mamak
ou avunculus). De par ses droits et ses devoirs, c’est lui le
vrai père des enfants de sa sœur.”<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> As regards the mountaineers
of Georgia, especially the Pshaves, M. Kovalevsky
states that, among them, “le frère de la mère prend la place
du père dans toutes les circonstances où il s’agit de venger le
sang répandu, surtout au cas de meurtre commis sur la personne
de son neveu.”<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Among the Goajiro Indians,<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> the
Negroes of Bondo,<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> the Barea, and the Bazes,<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> it is the mother’s
brother who has the right of selling a girl to her suitor. Touching
the Kois, the Rev. John Cain says, “The maternal uncle
of any Koi girl has the right to bestow her hand on any one
of his sons, or any other suitable candidate who meets with
his approval. The father and the mother of the girl have no
acknowledged voice in the matter. A similar custom prevails
amongst some of the Komâti (Vaiśya) caste.”<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Among the
Savaras in India, the bridegroom has to give a bullock not
only to the girl’s father, but to the maternal uncle;<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> whilst
among the Creeks, the proxy of the suitor asked for the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>sent
of the uncles, aunts, and brothers of the young woman,
“the father having no voice or authority in the business.”<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>But such cases are rare. Besides, most of them imply only
that the children in a certain way belong to the uncle, not
that the father is released from the obligation of supporting
them. Even where succession runs through females only, the
father is nearly always certainly the head of the family.
Thus, for instance, in Melanesia, where the clan of the
children is determined by that of the mother, “the mother
is,” to quote Dr. Codrington, “in no way the head of the
family. The house of the family is the father’s, the garden is
his, the rule and government are his.”<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> Nor is there any
reason to believe that it was generally otherwise in former
times. A man could not of course be the guardian of his
sister’s children, if he did not live in close connection with
them. But except in such a decidedly anomalous case as
that of the Malays, just referred to, this could scarcely happen
unless marriages were contracted between persons living
closely together. Nowadays, however, such marriages are
usually avoided, and I shall endeavour later on to show that
they were probably also avoided by our remote ancestors.</p>

<p>It might, further, be objected that the children were equally
well or better provided for, if not the fathers only, but all
the males of the tribe indiscriminately were their guardians.
The supporters of the hypothesis of promiscuity, and even
other sociologists, as for instance Herr Kautsky,<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> believe that
this really was the case among primitive men. According to
them, the tribe or horde is the primary social unit of the
human race, and the family only a secondary unit, developed
in later times. Indeed, this assumption has been treated by
many writers, not as a more or less probable hypothesis, but
as a demonstrated truth. Yet the idea that a man’s children
belong to the tribe, has no foundation in fact. Everywhere
we find the tribes or clans composed of several families, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
members of each family being more closely connected with
one another than with the rest of the tribe. The family, consisting
of parents, children, and often also their next descendants,
is a universal institution among existing peoples.<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
And it seems extremely probable that, among our earliest
human ancestors, the family formed, if not the society itself,
at least the nucleus of it. As this is a question of great
importance, I must deal with it at some length.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin remarks, “Judging from the analogy of the
majority of the Quadrumana, it is probable that the early
ape-like progenitors of man were likewise social.”<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> But it
may be doubted whether Mr. Darwin would have drawn this
inference, had he taken into consideration the remarkable
fact that none of the monkeys most nearly allied to man can
be called social animals.</p>

<p>The solitary life of the Orang-utan has already been noted.
As regards Gorillas, Dr. Savage states that there is only one
adult male attached to each group;<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and Mr. Reade says
expressly that they are not gregarious, though they sometimes
seem to assemble in large numbers.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Both Mr. Du Chaillu<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
and Herr von Koppenfels<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> assure us likewise that the Gorilla
generally lives in pairs or families.</p>

<p>The same is the case with the Chimpanzee. “It is seldom,”
Dr. Savage says, “that more than one or two nests are seen
upon the same tree or in the same neighbourhood; five have
been found, but it was an unusual circumstance. They do not
live in ‘villages’.... They are more often seen in pairs than
in gangs.... As seen here, they cannot be called gregarious.”<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>
This statement, confirmed or repeated by Mr. Du Chaillu<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> and
Professor Hartmann,<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> is especially interesting, as the Chim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>panzee
resembles man also in his comparatively slight strength
and courage, so that a gregarious life might be supposed to be
better suited to this animal.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer, however, has pointed out that not only size,
strength, and means of defence, but also the kind and distribution
of food and other factors must variously co-operate and
conflict to determine how far a gregarious life is beneficial, and
how far a solitary life.<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> Considering, then, that, according to
Dr. Savage, the Chimpanzees are more numerous in the season
when the greatest number of fruits come to maturity,<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> we may
almost with certainty infer that the solitary life generally led
by this ape is due chiefly to the difficulty it experiences in
getting food at other times of the year.</p>

<p>Is it not, then, most probable that our fruit-eating human
or half-human ancestors, living on the same kind of food, and
requiring about the same quantities of it as the man-like apes,
were not more gregarious than they? It is likely, too, that
subsequently, when man became partly carnivorous, he
continued, as a rule, this solitary kind of life, or that gregariousness
became his habit only in part. “An animal of a
predatory kind,” says Mr. Spencer, “which has prey that can
be caught and killed without help, profits by living alone:
especially if its prey is much scattered, and is secured by
stealthy approach or by lying in ambush. Gregariousness
would here be a positive disadvantage. Hence the tendency
of large carnivores, and also of small carnivores that have
feeble and widely-distributed prey, to lead solitary lives.”<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> It
is, indeed, very remarkable that even now there are savage
peoples who live rather in separate families than in tribes,
and that most of these peoples belong to the very rudest
races in the world.<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>“‘The wild or forest Veddahs,’” Mr. Pridham states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> “build
their huts in trees, live in pairs, only occasionally assembling
in greater numbers, and exhibit no traces of the remotest
civilization, nor any knowledge of social rites.”<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> According
to Mr. Bailey, the Nilgala Veddahs, who are considered the
wildest, “are distributed through their lovely country in small
septs, or families, occupying generally caves in the rocks,
though some have little bark huts. They depend almost
solely on hunting for their support, and hold little communication
even with each other.”<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>In Tierra del Fuego, according to Bishop Stirling, family life
is exclusive. “Get outside the family,” he says, “and relationships
are doubtful, if not hostile. The bond of a common
language is no security for friendly offices.”<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> Commander
Wilkes states likewise that the Fuegians “appear to live in
families and not in tribes, and do not seem to acknowledge
any chief;<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>” and, according to M. Hyades, “la famille est bien
constitutée, mais la tribu n’existe pas, à proprement parler.”<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
Each family is perfectly independent of all the others, and
only the necessity of common defence now and then induces
a few families to form small gangs without any chief.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
The Rev. T. Bridges writes to me, “They live in clans,
called by them Ucuhr, which means a house. These Ucuhr
comprise many subdivisions; and the members are necessarily
related. But,” he continues,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> “the Yahgans are a roving people,
having their districts and moving about within these districts
from bay to bay and island to island in canoes, without any
order. The whole clan seldom travels together, and only
occasionally and then always incidentally is it to be found
collected. The smaller divisions keep more together....
Occasionally, as many as five families are to be found living
in a wigwam, but generally two families.” Indeed, in ‘A
Voice for South America,’ Mr. Bridges says that “family
influence is the one great tie which binds these natives
together, and the one great preventive of violence.”<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the West Australians, who are probably better
known to him than to any other civilized man, Bishop
Salvado says that they “au lieu de se gouverner par tribus,
paraissent se gouverner à la manière patriarchale: chaque
famille, qui généralement ne compte pas plus de six à neuf
individus, forme comme une petite société, sous la seule dépendance
de son propre chef.... Chaque famille s’approprie une
espèce de district, dont cependant les families voisines jouissent
en commun si l’on vit en bonne harmonie.”<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>Mr. Stanbridge, who spent eighteen years in the wilds of
Victoria, tells us that the savages there are associated in tribes
or families, the members of which vary much in number. Each
tribe has its own boundaries, the land of which is parcelled out
amongst families and carefully transmitted by direct descent;
these boundaries being so sacredly maintained that the
member of no single family will venture on the lands of a
neighbouring one without invitation.<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> And touching the
Gournditch-mara, Mr. Howitt states that “each family
camped by itself.”<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>The Bushmans of South Africa, according to Dr. Fritsch,
are almost entirely devoid of a tribal organization. Even
when a number of families occasionally unite in a larger
horde, this association is more or less accidental, and not
regulated by any laws.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> But a horde commonly consists
of the different members of one family only, at least if the
children are old and strong enough to help their parents to
find food.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> “Sexual feelings, the instinctive love to children,
or the customary attachment among relations,” says Lichtenstein,
“are the only ties that keep them in any sort of
union.”<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The like is stated to be true of several peoples in Brazil. According
to v. Martius, travellers often meet there with a language
“used only by a few individuals connected with each other by
relationship, who are thus completely isolated, and can hold
no communication with any of their other countrymen far or
near.”<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> With reference to the Botocudos, v. Tschudi says
that “the family is the only tie which joins these rude children
of nature with each other.”<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> The Guachís, Mauhés, and
Guatós for the most part live scattered in families,<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> and the
social condition of the Caishánas, among whom each family
has its own solitary hut, “is of a low type, very little removed,
indeed, from that of the brutes living in the same forests.”<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>
The Marauá Indians live likewise in separate families or small
hordes, and so do some other of the tribes visited by Mr.
Bates.<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> According to Mr. Southey, the Cayáguas or Wood-Indians,
who inhabited the forests between the Paraná and
the Uruguay, were not in a social state; “one family lived at
a distance from another, in a wretched hut composed of
boughs; they subsisted wholly by prey, and when larger game
failed, were contented with snakes, mice, pismires, worms, and
any kind of reptile or vermin.”<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Again, speaking of the
Coroados, v. Spix and v. Martius say that “they live without
any bond of social union, neither under a republican nor a
patriarchal form of government. Even family ties are very
loose among them.”<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>The Togiagamutes, an Eskimo tribe, never visited by white
men in their own country until the year 1880, who lead a
thoroughly nomadic life, wandering from place to place in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
search of game or fish, appear, according to Petroff, “to live
in the most perfect state of independence of each other. Even
the communities do not seem bound together in any way;
families and groups of families constantly changing their
abode, leaving one community and joining another, or perhaps
forming one of their own. The youth, as soon as he is able
to build a kaiak and to support himself, no longer observes
any family ties, but goes where his fancy takes him, frequently
roaming about with his kaiak for thousands of miles before
another fancy calls him to take a wife, to excavate a miserable
dwelling, and to settle down for a time.”<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>The ancient Finns, too, according to the linguistic researches
of Professor Ahlqvist, were without any kind of
tribal organization. In his opinion, such a state would have
been almost impossible among them, as they lived in scattered
families for the sake of the chase and in order to have
pastures for their reindeer.<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>That the comparatively solitary life which the families of
these peoples live, is due to want of sufficient food, appears
from several facts. Lichtenstein tells us that the hardships
experienced by the Bushmans in satisfying the most urgent
necessities of life, preclude the possibility of their forming
larger societies. Even the families that form associations in
small separate hordes are sometimes obliged to disperse, as
the same spot will not afford sufficient sustenance for all.
“The smaller the number, the easier is a supply of food
procured.”<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>“Scarcity of food, and the facility with which they move
from one place to another in their canoes,” says Admiral
Fitzroy, “are, no doubt, the reasons why the Fuegians are
always so dispersed among the islands in small family parties,
why they never remain long in one place, and why a large
number are not seen many days in society.”<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>The natives of Port Jackson, New South Wales, when
visited a hundred years ago by Captain Hunter, were asso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>ciated
in tribes of many families living together, apparently
without a fixed residence, the different families wandering in
different directions for food, but uniting on occasions of
disputes with another tribe.<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> The Rev. A. Meyer assures us
likewise, as regards the Encounter Bay tribe, that “the whole
tribe does not always move in a body from one place to
another, unless there should be abundance of food to be
obtained at some particular spot; but generally they are
scattered in search of food.”<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Again, with reference to the
Australians more generally, Mr. Brough Smyth remarks that
“in any large area occupied by a tribe, where there was not
much forest land, and where kangaroos were not numerous, it
is highly probable that the several families composing the
tribe would withdraw from their companions for short periods,
at certain seasons, and betake themselves to separate portions
of the area, ... and it is more than probable—it is almost
certain—that each head of a family would betake himself, if
practicable, to that portion which his father had frequented.”<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>Finally, from Mr. Wyeth’s account in Schoolcraft’s great
work on the Indian Tribes of the United States, I shall make
the following characteristic quotation with reference to the
Snakes inhabiting the almost desert region which extends
southward from the Snake River as far as the southern end
of the Great Salt Lake, and eastward from the Rocky to the
Blue Mountains:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>—“The paucity of game in this region is, I
have little doubt, the cause of the almost entire absence of
social organization among its inhabitants; no trace of it is
ordinarily seen among them, except during salmon-time,
when a large number of the Snakes resort to the rivers,
chiefly to the Fishing Falls, and at such places there seems
some little organization.... Prior to the introduction of the
horse, no other tribal arrangement existed than such as is now
seen in the management of the salmon fishery.... The
organization would be very imperfect, because the remainder
of the year would be spent by them in families widely spread
apart, to eke out the year’s subsistence on the roots and
limited game of their country. After a portion of them, who
are now called Bonaks, had obtained horses, they would
naturally form bands and resort to the Buffalo region to gain
their subsistence, retiring to the most fertile places in their
own, to avoid the snows of the mountains and feed their horses.
Having food from the proceeds of the Buffalo hunt, to enable
them to live together, they would annually do so, for the protection
of their horses, lodges, &amp;c., &amp;c. These interests have
caused an organization among the Bonaks, which continues
the year through, because the interests which produce it
continue; and it is more advanced than that of the other
Snakes.”<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>Here, I think, we have an excellent account of the origin
of society, applicable not only to the Snakes, but, in its main
features, to man in general. The kind of food he subsisted
upon, together with the large quantities of it that he wanted,
probably formed in olden times a hindrance to a true gregarious
manner of living, except perhaps in some unusually
rich places. Man in the savage state, even when living
in luxuriant countries, is often brought to the verge of
starvation, in spite of his having implements and weapons
which his ruder ancestors had no idea of. If the obstacle
from insufficient food-supply could be overcome, gregariousness
would no doubt be of great advantage to him. Living
together, the families could resist the dangers of life and
defend themselves from their enemies much more easily
than when solitary,—all the more so, as the physical strength
of man, and especially savage man,<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> is comparatively slight.
Indeed, his bodily inferiority, together with his defencelessness
and helplessness, has probably been the chief lever of
civilization.</p>

<p>“He has,” to quote Mr. Darwin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> “invented and is able to
use various weapons, tools, traps, &amp;c., with which he defends
himself, kills or catches prey, and otherwise obtains food. He
has made rafts or canoes for fishing or crossing over to
neighbouring fertile islands. He has discovered the art of
making fire, by which hard and stringy roots can be rendered
digestible, and poisonous roots or herbs innocuous.”<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> In short,
man gradually found out many new ways of earning his
living and more and more emancipated himself from direct
dependence on surrounding nature. The chief obstacle to a
gregarious life was by this means in part surmounted, and the
advantages of such a life induced families or small gangs to
unite together in larger bodies. Thus it seems that the
gregariousness and sociability of man sprang, in the main,
from progressive intellectual and material civilization, whilst
the tie that kept together husband and wife, parents and
children, was, if not the only, at least the principal social
factor in the earliest life of man. I cannot, therefore, agree
with Sir John Lubbock that, as a general rule, as we descend
in the scale of civilization, the family diminishes, and the tribe
increases, in importance.<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> This may hold good for somewhat
higher stages, but it does not apply to the lowest stages.
Neither do I see any reason to believe that there <i>ever</i> was a
time when the family was quite absorbed in the tribe. There
does not exist a single well established instance of a people
among whom this is the case.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, deny that the tie which bound the
children to the mother was much more intimate and more
lasting than that which bound them to the father. But it
seems to me that the only result to which a critical investigation
of facts can lead us is, that in all probability there has been
no stage of human development when marriage has not
existed, and that the father has always been, as a rule, the
protector of his family. Human marriage appears, then, to
be an inheritance from some ape-like progenitor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<small>A CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY</small></h2>


<p>The inference drawn in the last chapter is opposed to the
view held by most sociologists who have written upon early
history. According to them, man lived originally in a state
of promiscuity. This is the opinion of Bachofen, McLennan,
Morgan, Lubbock, Bastian, Giraud-Teulon, Lippert, Kohler,
Post, Wilken, and several other writers.<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> Although suggested
at first only as a probable hypothesis, this presumption is now
treated by many writers as a demonstrated truth.<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>The promiscuity of primitive man is not, however, generally
considered to be perfectly indiscriminate, but limited to the
individuals belonging to the same tribe. It may, therefore,
perhaps be said to be a kind of marriage: polygyny combined
with polyandry. Sir John Lubbock has also given it
the name of “communal marriage,” indicating by this word,
that all the men and women in a community were regarded
as equally husbands and wives to one another. As I do not,
in speaking of marriage, take into consideration unions of so
indefinite a nature, this seems to be the proper place to discuss
the hypothesis in question.</p>

<p>The evidence adduced in support of it flows from two
sources. First, there are, in the books of ancient writers and
modern travellers, notices of some savage nations said to live
promiscuously; secondly, there are some remarkable customs
which are assumed to be social survivals, pointing to an
earlier stage of civilization, when marriage did not exist. Let
us see whether this evidence will stand the test of a critical
examination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Herodotus and Strabo inform us that, among the Massagetæ
every man had his own wife, but that all the other men of
the tribe were allowed to have sexual intercourse with her.<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
The Auseans, a Libyan people, had, according to the former,
their wives in common;<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> and Solinus reports the same of the
Garamantians of Ethiopia.<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Community of women is, further,
alleged to have occurred among the Liburnes, Galactophagi,<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>
and the ancient Bohemians.<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> And Garcilasso de la Vega
asserts that, among the natives of Passau in Peru, before the
time of the Incas, men had no separate wives.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>To these statements of ancient peoples Sir J. Lubbock adds
a few others concerning modern savages.<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> “The Bushmen of
South Africa,” he says, “are stated to be entirely without
marriage.” Sir Edward Belcher tells us that, in the Andaman
Islands, the custom is for the man and woman to remain
together until the child is weaned, when they separate, and
each seeks a new partner.<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> Speaking of the natives of Queen
Charlotte Islands, Mr. Poole says that among them “the
institution of marriage is altogether unknown,” and that the
women “cohabit almost promiscuously with their own tribe,
though rarely with other tribes.”<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> In the Californian Peninsula,
according to Baegert, the sexes met without any
formalities, and their vocabulary did not even contain the
word “to marry.”<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> Mr. Hyde states that, in the Pacific
Islands, there was an “utter absence of what we mean by the
family, the household, and the husband; the only thing possible
was to keep the line distinct through the mother, and enumerate
the successive generations with the several putative fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
Among the Nairs, as Buchanan tells us, no one knows his
father, and every man looks on his sister’s children as his heirs;
a man may marry several women, and a woman may be the
wife of several men.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> The Teehurs of Oude live together
almost indiscriminately in large communities, and even when
two people are regarded as married the tie is but nominal.<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
It is recorded that, among the Tôttiyars of India, “brothers,
uncles, nephews, and other kindred, hold their wives in common.”<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
And among the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills, when
a man marries a girl, she becomes the wife of all his brothers
as they successively reach manhood, and they become the
husbands of all her sisters when they are old enough to marry.<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>The Kámilarói tribes in South Australia are divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
four clans, in which brothers and sisters are respectively
Ipai and Ipātha, Kŭbi and Kubĭtha, Mŭri and Mātha, Kumbu
and Būtha. Ipai may only marry Kubĭtha; Kŭbi, Ipātha;
Kumbu, Mātha; and Mŭri, Būtha. In a certain sense, we are
told, every Ipai is regarded as married, not by any individual
contract, but by organic law, to every Kubĭtha; every Kŭbi
to every Ipātha, and so on. If, for instance, a Kŭbi “meet a
stranger Ipātha, they address each other as <i>spouse</i>. A Kŭbi
thus meeting an Ipātha, though she were of another tribe,
would treat her as his wife, and his right to do so would be
recognised by her tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> This institution, according to which
the men of one division, have as wives the women of
another division, the Rev. L. Fison calls “group marriage.”
He contends that, among the South Australians, it has
given way in later times, in some measure, to individual
marriage. But theoretically, as he says, marriage is still communal:
“it is based upon the marriage of all the males in one
division of a tribe to all the females of the same generation in
another division.” To this may be added a statement of the
Rev. C. W. Schürmann with reference to the Port Lincoln
aborigines. “As for near relatives, such as brothers,” he
remarks, “it may almost be said that they have their wives in
common.... A peculiar nomenclature has arisen from these
singular connections; a woman honours the brothers of the
man to whom she is married with the indiscriminate name of
husbands; but the men make a distinction, calling their own
individual spouses yungaras, and those to whom they have a
secondary claim, by right of brotherhood, kartetis.”<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Fuegians, Admiral Fitzroy says, “We had
some reason to think there were parties who lived in a promiscuous
manner—a few women being with many men.”<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> The
Lubus of Sumatra, the Olo Ot, together with a few other tribes
of Borneo, the Poggi Islanders, the Orang Sakai of Malacca,
and the mountaineers of Peling, east of Celebes, are by Pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>fessor
Wilken stated to be entirely without marriage.<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> The
same is said by Professor Bastian to be the case with the
Keriahs, Kurumbas, Chittagong tribes, Guaycurûs, Kutchin
Indians, and Arawaks.<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> He states, too, that the Jolah on the
island of St. Mary, according to Hewett, possess their women
in common,<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> and that, according to Magalhães, the like is true
of the Cahyapos in Matto Grosso.<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> We read in Dapper’s old
book on Africa, that certain negro tribes had neither law, nor
religion, nor any proper names, and possessed their wives in
common.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> These are all the statements known to me of
peoples alleged to be without marriage.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be remarked that some of the facts
adduced are not really instances of promiscuity. Sir Edward
Belcher’s statement as regards the Andamanese evidently suggests
monogamy; and among the Massagetæ and the Teehurs,
the occurrence of marriage is expressly confirmed, though the
marriage tie was loose. As for the aborigines of the Californian
Peninsula, it must be remembered that the want of an equivalent
for the verb “to marry” does not imply the want of the
fact itself. Baegert indicates, indeed, that marriage did occur
among them, when he says that “each man took as many
wives as he liked, and if there were several sisters in a family
he married them all together.”<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> And throughout the Pacific
Islands, marriage is a recognized institution. Nowhere has
debauchery been practised more extensively than among the
Areois of Tahiti. Yet Mr. Ellis assures us that, “although
addicted to every kind of licentiousness themselves, each
Arcoi had his own wife; ... and so jealous were they in this
respect that improper conduct towards the wife of one of their
own number was sometimes punished with death.”<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>As to the South Australians, Mr. Fison’s statements have
caused not a little confusion. On his authority several writers
assert that, among the Australian savages, groups of males
are actually found united to groups of females.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> But after
all, Mr. Fison does not seem really to mean to affirm the
present existence of group-marriages. The chief argument
advanced by him in support of his theory is grounded on the
terms of relationship in use in the tribes. These terms belong
to the “classificatory system” of Mr. Morgan;<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> but Mr. Fison
admits that he is not aware of any tribe in which the actual
practice is to its full extent what the terms of relationship
imply. “Present usage,” he says, “is everywhere in advance
of the system so implied, and the terms are survivals of an
ancient right, not precise indications of custom as it is.”<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a>
The same is granted by Mr. Howitt.<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Yet it will be pointed
out further on to what absurd results we must be led, if,
guided by such terms, we begin to speculate upon early
marriage. Moreover, if a Kŭbi and an Ipātha address each
other as spouse, this does not imply that in former times
every Kŭbi was married to every Ipātha indiscriminately.
On the contrary, the application of such a familiar term might
be explained from the fact that the women who may be a
man’s wives, and those who cannot possibly be so, stand in a
widely different relation to him.<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> It seems also as if a communism
in wives among the Port Lincoln aborigines had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
been inferred by Mr. Schürmann chiefly from the nomenclature.
Indeed, Mr. Curr, who has procured more information
regarding the Australian aborigines than any other investigator,
so far as I know, states that, in Australia, men and
women have never been found living in a state of promiscuous
intercourse, but <i>the reverse is a matter of notoriety</i>.<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> “It
seems to me,” he says, “after a careful examination of the
subject, that there is not within our knowledge a single fact,
or linguistic expression which requires us to have recourse to
the theory of group-marriage to explain it, but that there are
several ... directly at variance with that theory.”<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The
Rev. John Mathew asserts also, in his recent paper on ‘The
Australian Aborigines,’ that he fails to see that group-marriage
“has been proven to exist in the past, and it certainly
does not occur in Australia now.”<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> At any rate, it may be
asserted that such group-marriages are different from the
promiscuity which is presumed to have prevailed in primitive
society. And this may with even more reason be said of the
marriages of the Tôttiyars, Nairs and Todas, of which at
least those of the Todas have originated, I believe, in true
polyandry.</p>

<p>Many of the assertions made as to peoples living together
promiscuously are evidently erroneous. Travellers are often
apt to misapprehend the manners and customs of the peoples
they visit, and we should therefore, if possible, compare the
statements of different writers, especially when so delicate and
private a matter as the relation between the sexes is concerned.
Sir Edward Belcher’s statement about the Andamanese
has been disproved by Mr. Man, who, after a very careful
investigation of this people, says not only that they are strictly
monogamous, but that divorce is unknown, and conjugal
fidelity till death not the exception but the rule among them.<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a>
As regards the Bushmans, Sir John Lubbock does not indicate
the source from which he has taken the statement that they
are “entirely without marriage;” all the authorities I have
consulted, unanimously assert the reverse. Burchell was told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
that even a second wife is never taken until the first has become
old, and that the old wives remain with the husband on the
same terms as before.<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Barrow tells us almost the same.<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>
Indeed, as we have already seen, the family is the chief social
institution of this people.</p>

<p>With reference to the Fuegians, Mr. Bridges, who has lived
amongst them for thirty years, writes to me, “Admiral Fitzroy’s
supposition concerning parties among the natives who lived
promiscuously is false, and adultery and lewdness are condemned
as evil, though through the strength of animal
passions very generally indulged, but never with the consent
of husbands or wives, or of parents.” From the description
of Captain Jacobsen’s recent voyage to the North-Western
Coast of North America, it appears that marriage exists among
the Queen Charlotte Islanders also, although the husbands often
prostitute their wives.<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> As for Professor Wilken’s statements
about promiscuity among some peoples belonging to the Malay
race, Professor Ratzel calls their accuracy in question. At
least, among the Lubus, as Herr Van Ophuijsen assures us,
a man has to buy his wife, just as among the other Malay
peoples;<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> and Dr. Schwaner expressly says that all that we
know about the Olo Ot depends on hearsay only.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> But,
according to him, they are not without marriage.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>Some of Professor Bastian’s assertions are most astonishing.
Any one who takes the trouble to read Richardson’s, Kirby’s,
or Bancroft’s account of the Kutchin, will find that polygyny,
but not promiscuity, is prevalent among them, the husbands
being very jealous of their wives.<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> The same is stated by
v. Martius about the Arawaks, whose blood-feuds are generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
owing to jealousy and a desire to avenge violations of conjugal
rights.<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> The occurrence of marriage among them has also
been ascertained by Schomburgk and the Rev. W. H. Brett.<a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
The Guaycurûs are said by Lozano to be monogamous,<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> and
so, according to Captain Lewin, are as a rule the Chittagong
Hill tribes, as we shall find later on. Touching the Keriahs,
Colonel Dalton affirms only that they have no word for marriage
in their own language, but he does not deny that marriage
itself occurs among them; on the contrary, it appears that
they buy their wives.<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The Kurumbas are stated to be without
the marriage ceremony, but not without marriage.<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> And
Dapper’s assertion that certain negro tribes have their women
in common, has never, so far as I know, been confirmed by
more recent writers. Dr. Post has found no people in Africa
living in a state of promiscuity;<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> and Mr. Ingham informs
me, speaking of the Bakongo, that “they would be horrified
at the idea of promiscuous intercourse.”</p>

<p>The peoples who may possibly live in a state of promiscuity
have thus been reduced to a very small number. Considering
the erroneousness of so many of the statements on the subject,
it is difficult to believe in the accuracy of the others.<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Ethnography
was not seriously studied by the ancients, and their
knowledge of the African tribes was no doubt very deficient.
Pliny, in the same chapter where he states that, among the
Garamantians, men and women lived in promiscuous inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>course,
reports of another African tribe, the Blemmyans, that
they had no head, and that the mouth and eyes were in
the breast.<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> Besides, marriage is an ambiguous word. The
looseness of the marital tie, the frequency of adultery and
divorce, and the absence of the marriage ceremony may
entitle us to say that, among many savage peoples, marriage
in the European sense of the term does not exist. But this is
very different from promiscuity.</p>

<p>Even if some of the statements are right, and the intercourse
between the sexes among a few peoples really is, or has been,
promiscuous, it would be a mistake to infer that these
utterly exceptional cases represent a stage of human development
which mankind, as a whole, has gone through. Further,
nothing would entitle us to consider this promiscuity as a
survival of the primitive life of man, or even as a mark of a
very rude state of society. It is by no means among the lowest
peoples that sexual relations most nearly approach to promiscuity.
Mr. Rowney, for instance, states that, among the Butias,
the marriage tie is so loose that chastity is quite unknown,
that the husbands are indifferent to the honour of their wives,
that “the intercourse of the sexes is, in fact, promiscuous.”
But the Butias are followers of Buddha, and “can hardly be
counted among the <i>wild</i> tribes of India, for they are, for the
most part, in good circumstances, and have a certain amount of
civilization among them.”<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> On the other hand, among the
lowest races on earth, as the Veddahs, Fuegians, and Australians,
the relation of the sexes are of a much more definite
character. The Veddahs are a truly monogamous people, and
have a saying that “death alone separates husband and wife.”<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>
And with reference to the Australians, Mr. Brough Smyth,
states that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> “though the marriages of Aboriginals are not
solemnized by any rites, ... it must not be supposed that,
as a rule, there is anything like promiscuous intercourse. When
a man obtains a good wife, he keeps her as a precious possession,
as long as she is fit to help him, and minister to his wants, and
increase his happiness. No other man must look with affection
towards her.... Promiscuous intercourse is abhorrent to many
of them.” Among the aborigines of the northern and central
parts of Australia, there are certainly women wholly given up to
common lewdness, and a man is said to be considered a bad
host who will not lend his wife to a guest. But Mr. Brough
Smyth thinks that these practices are modern, and have been
acquired since the aborigines were brought in contact with
the lower class of the whites, for “they are altogether irreconcilable
with the penal laws in force in former times amongst
the natives of Victoria.”<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> It seems obvious, then, that even if
there are peoples who actually live promiscuously, these do not
afford any evidence whatever for promiscuity having prevailed
in primitive times. Now let us examine whether the other
arguments are more convincing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“A further fact,” Dr. Post says, “which speaks for sexual
intercourse having originally been unchecked, is the wide-spread
custom that the sexes may cohabit perfectly freely
previous to marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>The immorality of many savages is certainly very great, but
we must not believe that it is characteristic of uncivilized races
in general. There are numerous savage and barbarous peoples
among whom sexual intercourse out of wedlock is of rare
occurrence, unchastity, at least on the part of the woman, being
looked upon as a disgrace and even as a crime.</p>

<p>“A Kafir woman,” Barrow says, “is chaste and extremely
modest;”<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> and Mr. Cousins writes to me that, between their
various feasts, the Kafirs, both men and women, have to live
in strict continence, the penalty being banishment from the
tribe, if this law is broken. Proyart states that, among the
people of Loango, “a youth durst not speak to a girl except
in her mother’s presence,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> “the crime of a maid who has
not resisted seduction, would be sufficient to draw down a
total ruin on the whole country, were it not expiated by a
public avowal made to the king.”<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> Among the Equatorial
Africans, mentioned by Mr. Winwood Reade, a girl who disgraces
her family by wantonness is banished from her clan;
and, in cases of seduction, the man is severely flogged.<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> In
Dahomey, if a man seduces a girl, the law compels marriage,
and the payment of eighty cowries to the parent or master.<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>
In Tessaua, according to Dr. Barth, a fine of 100,000 kurdi is
imposed on the father of a bastard child—a sum which indicates
how seldom such children are born there.<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> Among
the Beni-Mzab, a man who seduces a young girl has to pay
two hundred francs, and is banished for four years.<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> Among
the Beni-Amer, according to Munzinger, the unmarried women
are very modest, though the married women believe that they
are allowed everything.<a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Among the Arab girls in Upper
Egypt, unchastity is made impossible by an operation when they
are from three to five years old;<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> and among the Marea, continence
is a scarcely less necessary virtue, as a maiden or
widow who becomes pregnant is killed together with the
seducer and the child.<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> As regards the Kabyles, Messrs.
Hanoteau and Letourneux assert, “Les mœurs ne tolèrent
même aucune relation sexuelle en dehors du mariage....
L’enfant né en dehors du mariage est tué ainsi que sa mère.”<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>Among the Central Asian Turks, according to Vámbéry, a
fallen girl is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Among the Kalmucks,<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> as also the
Gypsies,<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> the girls take pride in having gallant affairs, but are
dishonoured if they have children previous to marriage. A
seducer among the Tunguses is bound to marry his victim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and pay the price claimed for her.<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> In Circassia, an incontinent
daughter is generally sold as soon as possible, being a
disgrace to her parents.<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Among the wretched inhabitants
of Lob-nor, “immorality is severely punished.”<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> And regarding
the Let-htas, a Hill Tribe of Burma, Mr. O’Riley
states that, until married, the youth of both sexes are
domiciled in two long houses at opposite ends of the
village, and “when they may have occasion to pass each
other, they avert their gaze, so they may not see each
other’s faces.”<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>As to the aborigines of the Indian Archipelago, Professor
Wilken states that side by side with peoples who indulge in
great licentiousness, there are others who are remarkably
chaste. Thus, in Nias, the pregnancy of an unmarried girl is
punished with death, inflicted not only upon her but upon the
seducer.<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Among the Hill Dyaks, the young men are carefully
separated from the girls, licentious connections between
the sexes being strictly prohibited;<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> and the Sibuyaus, a tribe
belonging to the Sea Dyaks, though they do not consider the
sexual intercourse of their young people a positive crime, yet
attach an idea of great indecency to irregular connections, and
are of opinion that an unmarried woman with child must be
offensive to the superior powers.<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>By some of the independent tribes of the Philippines also,
according to Chamisso, chastity is held in great honour, “not
only among the women, but also among the young girls, and
is protected by very severe laws;”<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a>—a statement which is
confirmed by Dr. Hans Meyer and Professor Blumentritt with
reference to the Igorrotes of Luzon.<a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>In New Guinea, too, chastity is strictly maintained.<a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> Mr.
G. A. Robinson and the Catechist Clark, who lived for years
with the aborigines, both declare their belief in the virtue of the
young women;<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> and Dr. Finsch assures us that the natives of
Dory are, in that respect, superior to many civilized nations in
Europe.<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> The French naturalists and some English writers
spoke highly of the morality of the young people among the
Tasmanians.<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> The women of Uea, Loyalty Islands, are described
by Erskine as “strictly chaste before marriage, and
faithful wives afterwards.”<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> In Fiji, great continence prevailed
among the young folk, the lads being forbidden to approach
women till eighteen or twenty years old.<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> Speaking of the
aborigines of Melanesia, Dr. Codrington remarks, “It is
certain that in these islands generally there was by no means
that insensibility in regard to female virtue with which the
natives are so commonly charged.”<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> In Samoa, the girls were
allowed to cohabit with foreigners, but not with their countrymen,<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>
and the chastity of the chiefs’ daughters was the pride
of the tribe. But Mr. Turner remarks that, though this virtue
was ostensibly cultivated here by both sexes, it was more a
name than a reality.<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>With reference to the Australian natives, Mr. Moore Davis
says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> “Promiscuous intercourse between the sexes is not practised
by the Aborigines, and their laws on the subject, particularly
those of New South Wales, are very strict. When at
camp, all the young unmarried men are stationed by themselves
at the extreme ends, while the married men, each with
his family, occupy the centre. No conversation is allowed
between the single men and the girls or the married
women.... Infractions of these and other laws were visited
either by punishment by any aggrieved member of the tribe,
or by the delinquent having to purge himself of his crime by
standing up protected simply by his shield, or a waddy, while
five or six warriors threw, from a comparatively short distance,
several spears at him.”<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Concerning several tribes in Western
Victoria, Mr. Dawson likewise states that, at the corroborees
and great meetings of the tribes, unmarried adults of both
sexes are kept strictly apart from those of another tribe.
“Illegitimacy is rare,” he says, “and is looked upon with such
abhorrence that the mother is always severely beaten by her
relatives, and sometimes put to death and burned. Her child
is occasionally killed and burned with her. The father of the
child is also punished with the greatest severity, and occasionally
killed.”<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>Turning to the American peoples: among the early Aleuts,
according to Veniaminof, “girls or unmarried females who
gave birth to illegitimate children were to be killed for shame,
and hidden.”<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> Egede tells us that, among the Greenlanders,
unmarried women observed the rules of modesty much better
than married women. “During fifteen full years that I lived
in Greenland,” he says, “I did not hear of more than two or
three young women, who were gotten with child unmarried;
because it is reckoned the greatest of infamies.”<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> According
to Cranz, a Greenland maid would take it as an affront were
a young fellow even to offer her a pinch of snuff in company.<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
Among the Northern Indians, girls are from the early age of
eight or nine years prohibited by custom from joining in the
most innocent amusements with children of the opposite sex.
“When sitting in their tent,” says Hearne, “or even when
travelling, they are watched and guarded with such an unremitting
attention as cannot be exceeded by the most rigid
discipline of an English boarding-school.”<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> Mr. Catlin asserts
that, among the Mandans, female virtue is, in the respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
families, as highly cherished as in any society whatever.<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a>
Among the Nez Percés,<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> the Apaches,<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> and certain other
North American peoples,<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> the women are described as remarkably
chaste, the seducer being viewed by some of them
with even more contempt than the girl he has dishonoured.
And Dobrizhoffer praises the Abiponian women for their
virtuous life.<a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>If we add to these facts those which will be adduced
further on, showing what man requires in his bride, it must
be admitted that the number of uncivilized peoples among
whom chastity, at least as regards women, is held in honour
and, as a rule, cultivated, is very considerable. There being
nothing to indicate that the morality of those nations ever was
laxer, the inference of an earlier stage of promiscuity from the
irregular sexual relations of unmarried people, could not apply
to them, even if such an inference, on the whole, were right.
But this is far from being the case: first, because the wantonness
of savages, in several cases, seems to be due chiefly to the
influence of civilization; secondly, because it is quite different
from promiscuity.</p>

<p>It has been sufficiently proved that contact with a higher
culture, or, more properly, the dregs of it, is pernicious to the
morality of peoples living in a more or less primitive condition.
In Greenland, says Dr. Nansen, “the Eskimo women of the
larger colonies are far freer in their ways than those of the
small outlying settlements where there are no Europeans.”<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>
And the Yokuts of California, amongst whom the freedom of
the unmarried people of both sexes is very great now, are said
to have been comparatively virtuous before the arrival of the
Americans.<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> In British Columbia and Vancouver Island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
“amongst the interior tribes, in primitive times, breaches of
chastity on the part either of married or unmarried females
were often punished with death, inflicted either by the brother
or husband;” whilst, among the fish-eaters of the north-west
coast, “it has no meaning, or, if it has, it appears to be utterly
disregarded.”<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> Again, among the Queen Charlotte Islanders
the present depravation has, according to Captain Jacobsen
been caused by the gold diggers who went there in the middle
of this century.<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> Admiral Fitzroy observed, too, that the
unchastity of the Patagonian women did not correspond with
the pure character attributed to them at an earlier time by
Falkner, and he thinks that “their ideas of propriety may have
been altered by the visits of licentious strangers.”<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> A more
recent traveller, Captain Musters, observed, indeed, little
immorality amongst the Indians whilst in their native wilds.<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p>There is, further, no doubt that the licentiousness of many
South Sea Islanders, at least to some extent, owes its origin
to their intercourse with Europeans. When visiting the Sandwich
Islands with Cook, Vancouver saw little or no appearance
of wantonness among the women. But when he visited them
some years afterwards, it was very conspicuous; and he
ascribes this change in their habits to their intercourse with
foreigners.<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Owing to the same influence, the women of Ponapé
and Tana lost their modesty;<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> and the privileges granted to
foreigners in Samoa have been already mentioned. Nay, even
in Tahiti, so notorious for the licentiousness of its inhabitants,
immorality was formerly less than it is now. Thus, as a girl,
betrothed when a child, grew up, “for the preservation of her
chastity, a small platform of considerable elevation was
erected for her abode within the dwelling of her parents.
Here she slept and spent the whole of the time she passed
within doors. Her parents, or some member of the family,
attended her by night and by day, supplied her with every
necessary, and accompanied her whenever she left the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Some of their traditions,” Ellis adds, “warrant the inference
that this mode of life, in early years, was observed by other
females besides those who were betrothed.”<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the tribes who once inhabited the Adelaide
Plains of South Australia, Mr. Edward Stephens, who went
to Australia about half a century ago, remarks, “Those who
speak of the natives as a naturally degraded race, either do
not speak from experience, or they judge them by what they
have become when the abuse of intoxicants and contact with
the most wicked of the white race have begun their deadly
work. As a rule, to which there are no exceptions, if a
tribe of blacks is found away from the white settlement, the
more vicious of the white men are most anxious to make the
acquaintance of the natives, and that, too, solely for purposes
of immorality.... I saw the natives and was much with them
before those dreadful immoralities were well known, ... and
I say it fearlessly, that nearly all their evils they owed to the
white man’s immorality and to the white man’s drink.”<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p>The Rev. J. Sibree tells us that, among most of the tribes of
Madagascar, the unchastity of girls does not give umbrage.
But “there are some other tribes,” he says, “more isolated, as
certain of the eastern peoples, where a higher standard of
morality prevails, girls being kept scrupulously from any
intercourse with the other sex until they are married.”<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p>Nowhere has chastity been more rigorously insisted upon
than among the South Slavonians. A fallen girl among
them has lost almost all chance of getting married. She is
commonly despised and often punished in a very barbarous
way; whilst, on the other hand, purity gives a girl a higher
value than the greatest wealth. In some places, a father or a
brother may even kill a man whom he finds with his daughter
or sister. But Dr. Krauss assures us that this rigidity in their
morals has gradually decreased, the more foreign civilization
has got a footing among them.<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Again, Professor Ahlqvist believes that illicit intercourse
between the sexes was almost unknown among the ancient
Finns, as the terms used by them with reference to such connections
are borrowed from other languages.<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> And Professor
Vámbéry makes the same observation as regards the primitive
Turko-Tartars. “The difference in morality,” he says,
“which exists between the Turks affected by a foreign civilization
and kindred tribes inhabiting the steppes, becomes
very conspicuous to any one living among the Turkomans
and Kara-Kalpaks; for whether in Africa or Asia,
certain vices are introduced only by the so-called bearers of
culture.”<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<p>Apart from such cases of foreign influence, we may perhaps
say that irregular connections between the sexes have on the
whole exhibited a tendency to increase along with the progress
of civilization. Dr. Fritsch remarks that the Bushmans are
much stricter in that matter than their far more advanced
neighbours.<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> Robert Drury assures us that, in Madagascar,
“there are more modest women, in proportion to the number
of people, than in England.”<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> Tacitus praised the chastity of
the Germanic youth, in contrast to the licentiousness of the
highly civilized Romans. These statements may to a certain
extent be considered typical. In Europe, there are born
among towns-people, on an average, twice as many bastard
children, in proportion to the number of births, as among the
inhabitants of the country, who generally lead a more natural
life. In France, according to Wappäus, the ratio was found
even so great as 15·13 to 4·24; though in Saxony, with its
manufacturing country people, it was only as 15·39 to 14·64.<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>
Nay, in Gratz and Munich the illegitimate births are even
more numerous than the legitimate.<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The prostitution of
the towns makes the difference in morality still greater; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
unfortunately the evil is growing. Almost everywhere prostitution
increases in a higher ratio than population.<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> In
consideration of these facts, it is almost ridiculous to speak of
the immorality of unmarried people among savages as a relic
of an alleged primitive stage of promiscuity.</p>

<p>There are several factors in civilization which account for
this bad result. The more unnatural mode of living and the
greater number of excitements exercise, no doubt, a deteriorating
influence on morality; and poverty makes prostitutes
of many girls who are little more than children. But the chief
factor is the growing number of unmarried people. It is proved
that, in the cities of Europe, prostitution increases according
as the number of marriages decreases.<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> It has also been
established, thanks to the statistical investigations of Engel
and others, that the fewer the marriages contracted in a year,
the greater is the ratio of illegitimate births.<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> Thus, by making
celibacy more common, civilization promotes sexual irregularity.
It is true that more elevated moral feelings, concomitants
of a higher mental development, may, to a certain extent, put
the drag on passion. But in a savage condition of life, where
every full-grown man marries as soon as possible; where
almost every girl, when she reaches the age of puberty, is given
in marriage; where, consequently, bachelors and spinsters are
of rare occurrence,—there is comparatively little reason for
illegitimate relations.<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Marriage, it seems to me, is the natural
form of the sexual relations of man, as of his nearest allies
among the lower animals. Far from being a relic of the
primitive life of man, irregularity in this respect is an anomaly
arising chiefly from circumstances associated with certain
stages of human development.</p>

<p>Dr. Post’s argument, as I have said, is open to another
objection. Free sexual intercourse previous to marriage is
quite a different thing from promiscuity, the most genuine form
of which is prostitution. But prostitution is rare among peoples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
living in a state of nature and unaffected by foreign influence.<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>
It is contrary to woman’s natural feelings as involving a
suppression of individual inclinations. In free sexual intercourse
there is selection; a woman has for one man, or for
several men, a preference which generally makes the connections
more durable.</p>

<p>Nowhere are unmarried people of both sexes less restrained
than among the savage nations of India and Indo-China. Yet
among these savage nations there is no promiscuity. Among
the Toungtha, for instance, according to Captain Lewin, prostitution
is not understood, and, when explained, it is regarded by
them with abhorrence. “They draw rightly a strong distinction
between a woman prostituting herself habitually as a means
of livelihood, and the intercourse by mutual consent of two
members of opposite sexes, leading, as it generally does, to
marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> Among the Tipperahs,<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> Oráons,<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> and Kolyas<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>,
unmarried girls may cohabit freely with young men, but are
never found living promiscuously with them. Among the
Dyaks on the Batang Lupar, too, unchastity is not rare, but a
woman usually confines herself to one lover. “Should the girl
prove with child,” says Sir Spenser St. John, “it is an understanding
between them that they marry”; and the men seldom,
by denying the paternity, refuse to fulfil their engagements.<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>
Again, in Tonga, it was considered disgraceful for a girl to
change lovers often. And in Scotland, prior to the Reformation,
there was a practice called “hand-fasting,” which certainly
may be characterized as unrestrained freedom before marriage,
but not as promiscuity. “At the public fairs,” the Rev. Ch.
Rogers states, “men selected female companions with whom to
cohabit for a year. At the expiry of this period both parties
were accounted free; they might either unite in marriage or
live singly.”<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>The attempt to explain free intercourse between unmarried
people as a relic of a primitive condition of general promiscuity
or rather, to infer the latter from the former, must thus, in
every respect, be considered a complete failure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir John Lubbock thinks that his hypothesis of “communal
marriage” derives additional support from some curious
customs, which he interprets as acts of expiation for individual
marriage. “In many cases,” he says, “the exclusive possession
of a wife could only be legally acquired by a temporary recognition
of the pre-existing communal rights.”<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>Thus Herodotus states that, in Babylonia, every woman was
obliged once in her life to give herself up, in the temple of
Mylitta, to strangers, for the satisfaction of the goddess; and
in some parts of Cyprus, he tells us, the same custom prevailed.<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>
In Armenia, according to Strabo, there was a very similar
law. The daughters of good families were consecrated to
Anaitis, a phallic divinity like Mylitta, giving themselves, as
it appears, to the worshippers of the goddess indiscriminately.<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>
Again, in the valleys of the Ganges, virgins were compelled
before marriage to offer themselves up in the temples dedicated
to Juggernaut. And the same is said to have been customary
in Pondicherry and at Goa.<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>These practices, however, evidently belong to phallic-worship,
and occurred, as Mr. McLennan justly remarks, among peoples
who had advanced far beyond the primitive state. The farther
back we go, the less we find of such customs in India; “the
germ only of phallic-worship shows itself in the Vedas, and
the gross luxuriance of licentiousness, of which the cases
referred to are examples, is of later growth.”<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>Ancient writers tell us that, among the Nasamonians and
Augilæ, two Libyan tribes, the <i>jus primae noctis</i> was accorded
to all the guests at a marriage.<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> Garcilasso de la
Vega asserts that, in the province Manta in Peru, marriages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
took place on condition that the bride should first yield
herself to the relatives and friends of the bridegroom.<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> In the
Balearic Islands, according to Diodorous Siculus, the bride was
for one night considered the common property of all the guests,
after which she belonged exclusively to her husband.<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> And
v. Langsdorf reports the occurrence of a very similar practice
in Nukahiva.<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p>With regard to Sir J. Lubbock’s interpretation of these
customs, as acts of expiation for individual marriage, Mr.
McLennan remarks that they are not cases of privileges
accorded to the men of the bridegroom’s group only, which
they should be, if they refer to an ancient communal right.<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>
It may also be noted that, in Nukahiva, the license was dependent
upon the will of the bride. Moreover, the freedom granted
to the wedding guests may be simply and naturally explained.
It may have been a part of the nuptial entertainment—a
horrible kind of hospitality, no doubt, but quite in accordance
with savage ideas, and analogous to another custom, which
occurs much more frequently; I mean the practice of lending
wives.</p>

<p>Among many uncivilized peoples, it is customary for a man
to offer his wife, or one of his wives, to strangers for the time
they stay in his hut. Even this practice has been adduced by
several writers as evidence of a former communism.<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> To
Sir John Lubbock it seems to involve the recognition of “a
right inherent in every member of the community, and to
visitors as temporary members.” Were this so, we should
certainly have to conclude that “communal marriage” has
been very prevalent in the human race, the practice of lending
wives occurring among many peoples in different parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
world.<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> But it is difficult to see how the practice could ever have
been in any way connected with communism in women for all
men belonging to the same tribe. It is not always the wife
that is offered; it may as well be a daughter, a sister, or a
servant.<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> Thus the people of Madagascar warn strangers to
behave with decency to their wives, though they readily offer
their daughters;<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> and it is asserted that a Tungus “will give
his daughter for a time to any friend or traveller that he takes
a liking to,” and if he has no daughter, he will give his servant,
but not his wives.<a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></p>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted that such customs are due merely
to savage ideas of hospitality. When we are told that, among
the coast tribes of British Columbia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> “the temporary present of
a wife is one of the greatest honours that can be shown there
to a guest;”<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> or that such an offer was considered by the
Eskimo “as an act of generous hospitality;”<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> or, that “this is
the common custom when the negroes wish to pay respect to
their guests,”<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>—I cannot see why we should look for a deeper
meaning in these practices than that which the words imply.
A man offers a visitor his wife as he offers him a seat at his
table. It is the greatest honour a savage can show his guest,
as a temporary exchange of wives—a custom prevalent in
North America, Polynesia, and elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>—is regarded as a
seal of the most intimate friendship. Hence, among the
Greenlanders, those men were reputed the best and noblest
tempered, who, without any pain or reluctance, would lend
their friends their wives:<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> and the men of Caindu, a region of
Eastern Tibet, hoped by such an offering to obtain the
favour of the gods.<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> Indeed, if the practice of lending wives is
to be regarded as a relic of ancient communism in women, we
may equally well regard the practice of giving presents to
friends, or hospitality in other respects, as a remnant of ancient
communism in property of every kind.</p>

<p>The <i>jus primae noctis</i> granted to the friends of the bridegroom
may, however, be derived from another source. Touching the
capture of wives, Mr. Brough Smyth states that, in New South
Wales and about Riverina, “in any instance where the abduction
has taken place by a party of men for the benefit of some
one individual, each of the members of the party claims, as a
right, a privilege which the intended husband has no power to
refuse.”<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> A similar custom prevails, according to Mr. Johnston,
among the Wa-taïta in Eastern Central Africa, though the
capture here is a symbol only. After the girl has been bought
by the bridegroom, she runs away and affects to hide. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
she is sought out by him and three or four of his friends.
When she is found, the men seize her and carry her off to the
hut of her future husband, where she is placed at the disposal
of her captors.<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> In such cases the <i>jus primae noctis</i> is a reward
for a good turn done, or perhaps, as Mr. McLennan suggests,<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>
a common war-right, exercised by the captors of the woman.
If we knew all the circumstances, this explanation might prove
to hold good also with regard to the right granted to the
wedding-guests in the cases we have mentioned. At any rate,
it must be admitted that these strange customs may be
interpreted in a much simpler way than that suggested by Sir
John Lubbock.</p>

<p>There are some instances of <i>jus primae noctis</i> accorded to a
particular person, a chief or a priest. Thus, among the Kinipetu-Eskimo,
the Ankut, or high-priest has this right.<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> Among
the Caribs, the bridegroom received his bride from the hand of
the Piache, or medicine-man, and certainly not as a virgin.<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a>
A similar custom is met with among certain Brazilian tribes,
though in some of these cases it is to the chief that the right
in question belongs.<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> The Spanish nobleman Andagova states
that, in Nicaragua, a priest living in the temple was with the
bride during the night preceding her marriage.<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> And among
the Tahus in Northern Mexico according to Castañeda, the
<i>droit du seigneur</i> was accorded to the cacique.<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>In descriptions of travel in the fifteenth century, the
aboriginal inhabitants of Teneriffe are represented as having
married no woman who had not previously spent a night with
the chief, which was considered a great honour.<a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
right, according to Dr. Barth, was presumably granted to the
chief of Bagele in Adamáua;<a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> and, according to Herodotus, to
the king of the ancient Adyrmachidae.<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> Navarette tells us
that, on the coast of Malabar, the bridegroom brought the
bride to the king, who kept her eight days in his palace;
and the man took it “as a great honour and favour that
his king would make use of her.”<a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> Again, according to
Hamilton, a Samorin could not take his bride home for three
nights, during which the chief priest had a claim to her company.<a id="FNanchor_407_407" href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>
Sugenheim believes even that, in certain parts of
France, a similar right was accorded to the higher clergy
during the Middle Ages.<a id="FNanchor_408_408" href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<p>Yet Dr. Karl Schmidt has endeavoured, in a learned work,
to prove that the <i>droit du siegneur</i> never existed in Europe,
the later belief in it being merely “ein gelehrter Aberglaube,”
which arose in various ways. Thus there was classical witness
to ancient traditions of tyrants, who had distinguished
themselves by such proceedings as that right was supposed to
legalize. From various parts of the world came reports of
travellers as to tribes among whom defloration was the privilege
or duty of kings, priests, or other persons set apart for the
purpose. A grosser meaning than the words will warrant had,
besides, in Dr. Schmidt’s opinion, been attached to the fine
paid by the vassal to his feudal lord for permission to marry.
That law, he says, which is believed to have extended over
a large part of Europe, has left no evidence of its existence in
laws, charters, decretals, trials, or glossaries.<a id="FNanchor_409_409" href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>This is not the proper place to discuss Dr. Schmidt’s hypothesis;
but his arguments do not seem to be conclusive.<a id="FNanchor_410_410" href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a>
Several writers speak of estate-owners in Russia who claimed
the <i>droit du seigneur</i> in the last and even the present century;<a id="FNanchor_411_411" href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>
and a friend of mine informs me that, when travelling in that
country, he met with aged men whose wives had been victims
of the custom. It was certainly a privilege taken by the law
of might. But how in such cases shall we draw the line between
might and what is properly accepted as right?</p>

<p>Bachofen, Giraud-Teulon, Kulischer, and other writers<a id="FNanchor_412_412" href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>
regard the <i>jus primae noctis</i> accorded to a special person, as a
remnant of a primitive state of promiscuity or “communal
marriage.” It is, in their opinion, a transformation of the
ancient communal right, which was taken away from the
community and transferred to those who chiefly represented
it—the priest, the king, or the nobility.</p>

<p>But why may not the practice in question have been simply
a consequence of might? It may be a right taken forcibly by
the stronger, or it may be a privilege voluntarily given to the
chief man as a mark of esteem,—in either case, it depends upon
his authority. Indeed, the right of encroaching upon the
marital rights of a subject is not commonly restricted to the
first night only. Where the chief or the king has the power
of life and death, what man can prohibit him from doing his
will? “Quite indisputed,” Dr. Holub says, with reference to
the Marutse, “is the king’s power to put to death, or to make a
slave of any one of his subjects in any way he choses; he may
take a man’s wife simply by providing him with another wife
as a substitute.”<a id="FNanchor_413_413" href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> In Dahomey, all women belong to the king,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
who causes every girl to be brought to him before marriage,
and, if he pleases, retains her in the palace.<a id="FNanchor_414_414" href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> Among the
Negroes in Fida, according to Bosman, the captains of the
king, who have to supply him with fresh wives, immediately
present to him any beautiful virgin they may see; and none
of his subjects dare presume to offer objections.<a id="FNanchor_415_415" href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> In Persia,
it was a legal principle that whatever was touched by the king
remained immaculate, and that he might go into the harem of
any of his subjects.<a id="FNanchor_416_416" href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> Among the Kukis, “all the women of
the village, married or single, are at the pleasure of the rajah,”
who is regarded by his people with almost superstitious veneration.<a id="FNanchor_417_417" href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
The Kalmuck priests, who are not suffered to marry,
may, it is said, pass a night with any man’s wife, and this is
esteemed a favour by the husband.<a id="FNanchor_418_418" href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> And in Chamba (probably
Cochin China), Marco Polo tells us, no woman was
allowed to marry until the king had seen her.<a id="FNanchor_419_419" href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p>According to Dr. Zimmermann, it is a dogma among many
Malays that the rajah has the entire disposal of the wives and
children of his subjects.<a id="FNanchor_420_420" href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> In New Zealand, when a chief
desires to take to himself a wife, he fixes his attention upon
one and takes her, if need be by force, without consulting her
feelings and wishes, or those of any one else.<a id="FNanchor_421_421" href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> In Tonga, the
women of the lower people were at the disposal of the chiefs,
who even used to shoot the husbands, if they made resistance;<a id="FNanchor_422_422" href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a>
whilst in Congo, as we are told by Mr. Reade, when the king
takes a fresh concubine, her husband and all her lovers are
put to death.<a id="FNanchor_423_423" href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></p>

<p>In the interesting ‘Notes of a Country Clergyman’ in
<i>Russkaja Stariná</i> (‘Russian Antiquity’), much light is thrown
on the life of Russian landlords before the emancipation of the
serfs. Here is what is said of one of them:—“Often N. I—tsch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
would stroll late in the evening about his village to admire
the prosperous condition of his peasants; he would stop at
some cottage, look in at the window, and tap on the pane with
his finger. This tapping was well known to everybody, and
in a moment the best-looking woman of the family went out
to him.... Another landlord, whenever he visited his
estate, demanded from the manager, immediately after his
arrival, a list of all the grown-up girls. Then,” the author
continues, “the master took to his service each of the girls for
three or four days, and as soon as the list was finished, he went
off to another village. This occurred regularly every year.”<a id="FNanchor_424_424" href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p>Here we have a collection of facts, belonging, as I think, to
the same group as the <i>jus primae noctis</i> is of a chief or a priest.
And it is obvious that they have nothing to do with “communal
marriage.” The privilege accorded to the priest, however,
seems, in some cases, to have a purely religious origin. Thus,
Egede informs us that the native women of Greenland thought
themselves fortunate if an Angekokk, or prophet, honoured
them with his caresses; and some husbands even paid him,
because they believed that the child of such a holy man could
not but be happier and better than others.<a id="FNanchor_425_425" href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> Von Martius thinks
that the right granted to the medicine-man among the Brazilian
aborigines is owing to savage ideas of woman’s impurity.<a id="FNanchor_426_426" href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a>
And on the coast of Malabar, Hamilton says, the bride was
given to the chief priest, “because the first fruits of her nuptials
must be a holy oblation to the god she worships.”<a id="FNanchor_427_427" href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet another group of facts is adduced as evidence for the
hypothesis of ancient communism in women. Sir J. Lubbock
and Professor Giraud-Teulon cite some cases of courtesans
being held in greater estimation than women married to a single
husband, or, at least, being by no means despised.<a id="FNanchor_428_428" href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> Such
feelings, Sir John believes, would naturally arise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> “when the
special wife was a stranger and a slave, while the communal
wife was a relative and a free woman,” and would, in some
instances, long survive the social condition to which they owed
their origin.<a id="FNanchor_429_429" href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> The courtesans are thus regarded as representatives
of the communal wives of primitive times. But it seems
to me much more reasonable to suppose that if, in Athens
and India, courtesans were respected and sought after even by
the principal men, it was because they were the only educated
women.<a id="FNanchor_430_430" href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> Besides, as Mr. McLennan justly remarks with regard
to such “communal wives,” “if any inference is to be made
from their standing in Athens, in the brilliant age of Pericles,
as to the state of matters in the primitive groups, proof of
primitive communism in women might as well be sought in
London or Paris in our own day. Far back in the interval
between savagery and the age of Pericles are the heroes of
Homer with their noble wedded wives.”<a id="FNanchor_431_431" href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p>It is true that, among some uncivilized peoples, women
having many gallants are esteemed better than virgins, and
are more anxiously desired in marriage. This is, for instance,
stated to be the case with the Indians of Quito,<a id="FNanchor_432_432" href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> the Laplanders
in Regnard’s days,<a id="FNanchor_433_433" href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> and the Hill Tribes of North
Aracan.<a id="FNanchor_434_434" href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> But in each of these cases we are expressly told
that want of chastity is considered a merit in the bride,
because it is held to be the best testimony to the value of her
attractions. There are thus various reasons why courtesans
and licentious women may be held in respect and sought
after, and we need not, therefore, resort to Sir John Lubbock’s
far-fetched hypothesis.</p>

<small>A CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued</i>)</p>


<p>We are indebted to Mr. Lewis H. Morgan for information
as to the names of various degrees of kinship among no fewer
than 139 different races or tribes. This collection shows that
very many peoples have a nomenclature of relationships quite
different from our own. Mr. Morgan divides the systems into
two great classes, the descriptive and the classificatory, which
he regards as radically distinct. “The first,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> “which
is that of the Aryan, Semitic, and Uralian families, rejecting
the classification of kindred, except so far as it is in accordance
with the numerical system, describes collateral consanguinei,
for the most part, by an augmentation or combination of the
primary terms of relationship. These terms, which are those
for husband and wife, father and mother, brother and sister,
and son and daughter, to which must be added, in such
languages as possess them, grandfather and grandmother, and
grandson and granddaughter, are thus restricted to the primary
sense in which they are here employed. All other terms are
secondary. Each relationship is thus made independent and
distinct from every other. But the second, which is that of
the Turanian, American Indian, and Malayan families, rejecting
descriptive phrases in every instance, and reducing consanguinei
to great classes, by a series of apparently arbitrary generalizations,
applies the same terms to all the members of the same
class. It thus confounds relationships, which, under the
descriptive system, are distinct, and enlarges the signification
both of the primary and secondary terms beyond their
seemingly appropriate sense.”<a id="FNanchor_435_435" href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>The most primitive form of the classificatory group is the
system of the “Malayan family,”<a id="FNanchor_436_436" href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> which prevails among the
Hawaiians, Kingsmill Islanders, Maoris, and, presumably,
also among several other Polynesian and Micronesian tribes.<a id="FNanchor_437_437" href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>
According to this system, all consanguinei, near and remote,
are classified into five categories. My brothers and sisters
and my first, second, third, and more remote male and female
cousins, are the first category. To all these without distinction
I apply the same term. My father and mother, together with
their brothers and sisters, and their first, second, and more
remote cousins, are the second category. To all these without
distinction I apply likewise the same term. The brothers,
sisters, and several cousins of my grandparents I denominate
as if they were my grandparents; the cousins of my sons and
daughters, as if they were my sons and daughters; the grandchildren
of my brothers and sisters and their several cousins,
as if they were my own grandchildren. All the individuals of
the same category address each other as if they were brothers
and sisters. Uncleship, auntship, and cousinship being ignored,
we have, as far as the nomenclature is considered, only
grandchildren.<a id="FNanchor_438_438" href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p>From this system of nomenclature all the others belonging
to the classificatory group have, according to Mr. Morgan,
been gradually developed. The system of the Two-Mountain
Iroquois differs from that of the Hawaiians essentially in two
respects only, the mother’s brother being distinguished by a
special term, and so also a sister’s children. The Micmac system
is somewhat more advanced. Not only does a man call his
sister’s son his nephew, but a woman applies the same term to
her brother’s son; and not only is a mother’s brother termed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
an uncle, but also the father’s sister is distinguished by a special
term, as an aunt. A father’s brother is called a “little father;”
and a mother’s sister, a “little mother.” Still more advanced
is the system of the Wyandots, which may be regarded as the
typical system of the Indians.<a id="FNanchor_439_439" href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> A mother’s brother’s son and
a father’s sister’s son are no longer called by the same terms
as brothers, but are recognized as cousins; and women apply
to their mother’s brother’s grandsons no longer the same term
as to their sons, but call them nephews.</p>

<p>It is needless to enter into further details. Those who
shrink from the trouble of reading through Mr. Morgan’s
extensive tables, will find an excellent summary of them in the
fifth chapter of Sir John Lubbock’s great work on ‘The Origin
of Civilization.’ It may, however, be added that the most
advanced system of the classificatory group is that of the
Karens and Eskimo, which differs from our own in three
respects only. The children of cousins are termed nephews;
the children of nephews, grandchildren; and a grandfather’s
brothers and sisters, respectively, grandfathers and grandmothers.
“Hence,” says Sir John Lubbock, “though the
Karens and Eskimo have now a far more correct system of
nomenclature than that of many other races, we find, even in
this, clear traces of a time when these peoples had not advanced
in this respect beyond the lowest stage.”<a id="FNanchor_440_440" href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></p>

<p>From these systems of nomenclature Mr. Morgan draws very
far-reaching conclusions, assuming that they are necessarily
to be explained by early marriage customs. Thus, from the
“Malayan system,” he infers the former prevalence of “marriage
in a group” of all brothers and sisters and cousins of the same
grade or generation; or, more correctly, his case is, that if we
can explain the “Malayan system” on the assumption that
such a general custom once existed, then we must believe that
it did formerly exist. “Without this custom,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> “it is
impossible to explain the origin of the system from the nature
of descents. There is, therefore, a necessity for the prevalence
of this custom amongst the remote ancestors of all the nations
which now possess the classificatory system, if the system itself
is to be regarded as having a natural origin.”<a id="FNanchor_441_441" href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> The family
resulting from this custom he calls, in his latest work, the
“consanguine family,” and in this, consisting of a body of
kinsfolk, within which there prevailed promiscuity, or “communal
marriage,” between all men and women of the same
generation, the family in its first stage is recognized.<a id="FNanchor_442_442" href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> Mr.
Morgan believes, however, that as a necessary condition antecedent
to this form of the family, promiscuity, in a wider sense
of the term, may be theoretically deduced, though, as he says,
“it lies concealed in the misty antiquity of mankind beyond
the reach of positive knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_443_443" href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>It is needless here to consider whether the last conclusion
holds good. I shall endeavour to prove that Mr. Morgan’s
inference of a stage of promiscuous intercourse even within the
prescribed limits is altogether untenable. All depends on the
point whether the “classificatory system” is a system of
blood-ties, the nomenclature having been founded on blood-relationship,
as near as the parentage of individuals could be
known. Mr. Morgan assumes this, instead of proving it.</p>

<p>Yet in the terms themselves there is, generally, nothing
which indicates that they imply an idea of consanguinity.
Professor Buschmann has given us a very interesting list of
the names for father and mother in many different languages.<a id="FNanchor_444_444" href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a>
The similarity of the terms is striking. “Pa,” “papa,” or
“baba,” for instance, means father in several languages of the
Old and New World, and “ma,” “mama,” means mother. The
Tupis in Brazil have “paia” for father, and “maia” for mother;<a id="FNanchor_445_445" href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a>
the Uaraguaçú, respectively, “paptko” and “mamko.”<a id="FNanchor_446_446" href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> In
other languages the terms for father are “ab,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> “aba,” “apa,”
“ada,” “ata,” “tata”; those for mother, “ama,” “emä,” “ana,”
“ena,” &amp;c. According to Buschmann, there are four typical
forms of words for each of these ideas: for father, “pa,” “ta,”
“ap,” “at”; for mother, “ma,” “na,” “am,” “an.” Sometimes,
however, the meaning of the types is reversed. Thus, in
Georgian,<a id="FNanchor_447_447" href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> as well as in the Mahaga language of Ysabel,<a id="FNanchor_448_448" href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a>
“mama” stands for father; whilst the Tuluvas in Southern
India call the father “amme,” and the mother “appe.”<a id="FNanchor_449_449" href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>The terms used often fall outside of the types mentioned.
In the Lifu tongue, for example, one term for father is “kaka;”<a id="FNanchor_450_450" href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
in the Duauru language of Baladea, “chicha”;<a id="FNanchor_451_451" href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> in the
Maréan tongue, “chacha” or “cheche.”<a id="FNanchor_452_452" href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> Again, among the
Chalcha Mongols and some related peoples, mother is “ekè.”<a id="FNanchor_453_453" href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a>
In the Kanúri language, of Central Africa, the mother is called
“ya”;<a id="FNanchor_454_454" href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> while the Kechua in Brazil call the father “yaya.”<a id="FNanchor_455_455" href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
Among the Bakongo, as I am informed by Mr. Ingham, “se”
means father; in Finnish, “isä.” Again, by the Brazilian
Bakaĭri, the mother is called “ise”;<a id="FNanchor_456_456" href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> and, by the people of
Aneiteum, New Hebrides, “risi.”<a id="FNanchor_457_457" href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<p>Similar terms are often used for other relationships. The
Greek, “πάππος” signifies grandfather, and “μάμμα” grandmother.
In the Kanúri language, “yaya” stands for elder
brother;<a id="FNanchor_458_458" href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> and, in Lifuan, “mama” and “dhina” are terms for
brother, whilst mother is “thine.”<a id="FNanchor_459_459" href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p>The origin of such terms is obvious. They are formed from
the easiest sounds a child can produce. “‘Pa-pa,’ ‘ma-ma,‘
'tata,’ and ‘apa,’ ‘ama,’ ‘ata,’” Professor Preyer says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> “emerge
originally spontaneously, the way of the breath being barred
at the expiration, either by the lips (<i>p</i>, <i>m</i>), or by the tongue
(<i>d</i>, <i>t</i>).”<a id="FNanchor_460_460" href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> Yet the different races vary considerably with regard
to the ease with which they produce certain sounds. Thus the
pronunciation of the labials is very difficult to many Indians,<a id="FNanchor_461_461" href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>
on account of which their terms for father, mother, or other
near kinsfolk, often differ much from the types given by Professor
Buschmann.</p>

<p>It is evident that the terms borrowed from the children’s
lips have no intrinsic meaning whatever. Hence, if a Bakaĭri
child calls its father and father’s brother “tsogo,” its mother
and mother’s sister “tsego”;<a id="FNanchor_462_462" href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> if a Macúsi names his paternal
uncle “papa” as well as his father, and an Efatese names his
father and all the tribe brothers of his father “ava” or “tama”;<a id="FNanchor_463_463" href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>
if the Dacotahs apply the term “ahta” not only to the father,
but also to the father’s brother, to the mother’s sister’s
husband, to the father’s father’s brother’s son, &amp;c., and the
term “enah” not only to the mother, but also to the mother’s
sister, to the mother’s mother’s sister’s daughter, &amp;c.;<a id="FNanchor_464_464" href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> if,
among the New Caledonians, an uncle, taking the place of a
father, is called “baba” like the father himself, and an aunt is
called “gnagna” like a mother;<a id="FNanchor_465_465" href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> if, as Archdeacon Hodgson
of Zanzibar, writes to me, a native of Eastern Central Africa
uses the words “baba” and “mama” not only for father and
mother respectively, but also, very commonly, for “any near
relationship or even external connection;” if, finally, the
Semitic word for father, “ab” (“abu”), is not only used in a
wide range of senses, but, to quote Professor Robertson Smith,
“in all dialects is used in senses quite inconsistent with the idea
that procreator is the radical meaning of the word,”<a id="FNanchor_466_466" href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>—we
certainly must not, from these designations, infer anything as
to early marriage customs.</p>

<p>Of course there are other terms applied to kinsfolk besides
words taken from the lips of children, or words derived from
these. But though considerable, their number has been some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>what
exaggerated. Thus, for instance, Professor Vámbéry, in
his work upon the primitive culture of the Turko-Tartars, says
that the terms for mother, “ana” or “ene” have originally
the meaning of woman or nurse, being derived from the roots
“an” and “en.”<a id="FNanchor_467_467" href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> Exactly the reverse seems to be the fact,
the terms for mother being the primitive words. In the same
way, I cannot but think that Professor Max Müller and several
other philologists are in error in deriving “pitár,” “pater,”
“father,” from the root “pa,” which means to protect, to
nourish; and “mâtár,” “mater,” “mother,” from the root “ma,”
to fashion.<a id="FNanchor_468_468" href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> It seems, indeed, far more natural, as has been
pointed out by Sir J. Lubbock and others, that the roots “pa,”
to protect, and “ma,” to fashion, come from “pa,” father, and
“ma,” mother, and not <i>vice versa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_469_469" href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> I am the more inclined to
accept this explanation, as Mr. A. J. Swann informs me, from
Kavala Island, Lake Tanganyika, that among the Waguha, the
words “baba,” and “tata,” which mean father, also have the
meaning of protector, provider.</p>

<p>I do not deny that relationships—especially in the collateral
and descending lines—are in some cases denoted by terms
derived from roots having an independent meaning; but the
number of those that imply an idea of consanguinity does not
seem to be very great. Mr. Bridges writes that, among the Yahgans,
“the names ‘imu’ and ‘dabi’—father and mother—have
no meaning apart from their application, neither have any of
their other very definite and ample list of terms for relatives, except
the terms ‘macu’ and ‘macipa’ son and daughter. These
terms refer to ‘magu’ which means parturition; ‘cipa’ (‘keepa’)
signifies woman or female.” In Bakongo, according to Mr.
Ingham, “se” and “tata” denote father; “mama,” “mbuta,”
and “ngudi,” mother; “nfumu,” elder brother or sister;
“mbunzi,” younger brother; and “mbusi,” younger sister.
“Nfumu” means also Sir, chief; “mbuta” means “the one
who bore,” from “buta,” or “wuta,” to beget; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> “ngudi,”
“the one we descended from.” Again, Mr. Radfield informs
me that, in the language of Lifu, the term for father means
root; the term for mother, foundation or vessel; the term for
sister, forbidden or “not to be touched;” and the terms for
eldest and younger brother, respectively, ruler and ruled. It is
possible—I should even say probable—that, in these instances
also, the designations for relationships are the radical words.
Besides, it should be observed that, in Yahgan, “the terms for
relatives are strictly reserved for such, neither are they interchanged,”
and that in Bakongo, the terms “tata” and “mama”
are used as signs of respect to any one, whilst the terms
“mbuta” and “ngudi” seem to be applied exclusively to the
mother.</p>

<p>Not only has Mr. Morgan given no evidence for the truth of
his assumption that the “classificatory system” is a system
of blood-ties, but this assumption is not even fully consistent
with the facts he has himself stated. It is conceivable that
uncertainty as regards fatherhood might have led a savage to
call several men his fathers, but an analogous reason could never
have induced him to name several women his mothers. Hence,
if a man applies the same term to his mother’s sisters as to his
mother, and he himself is addressed as a son by a woman who
did not give birth to him, this evidently shows that the nomenclature,
at least in certain cases, cannot be explained by the
nature of descent.<a id="FNanchor_470_470" href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></p>

<p>There can be scarcely any doubt that the terms for relationships
are, in their origin, terms of address. “The American
Indians,” says Mr. Morgan, “always speak to each other, when
related, by the term of relationship, and never by the personal
name of the individual addressed.”<a id="FNanchor_471_471" href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> From a psychological
point of view, it would, indeed, be surprising if it could be
shown that primitive men, in addressing all the different
members of their family or tribe, took into consideration so
complicated a matter as the degree of consanguinity. Can we
really believe that a savage whose intelligence, perhaps, was
so deficient that he was scarcely able to count his own fingers,
applied the same term to his cousins as to his brothers, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
he was not certain whether, after all, they were not his brothers
and that, when he did make a distinction between them,
he did so <i>because</i> they were begotten by different fathers?
Facts show that savages generally denominate their kindred
according to much simpler principles, the names being given
chiefly with reference to sex and age, as also to the external
or social, relationship in which the speaker stands to the
person whom he addresses.</p>

<p>In every language there are different designations for persons
of different sexes. In the rudest system of nomenclature, the
Hawaiian, father and other kinsmen of the same generation
are called “makua kana;” mother, mother’s sisters, father’s
sisters, &amp;c., “makua waheena,” “kana” and “waheena” being
the terms for male and female. A son is called “kaikee kana,”
a daughter “kaikee waheena,” whilst “kana” alone is applied
to husband, husband’s brother, and sister’s husband, and
“waheena” to wife, wife’s sister, brother’s wife, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There are also separate terms in every language for relations
belonging to different generations. Among the lower races
especially, age, or, more exactly, the age of the person spoken
to compared with that of the speaker, plays a very important
part in the matter of denomination. According to Dr. Davy,
the Veddahs appear to be without names; “a Veddah interrogated
on the subject, said, ‘I am called a man: when young,
I was called the little man: and when old, I shall be called
the old man.’”<a id="FNanchor_472_472" href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> The Hawaiians, as we are informed by
Judge Andrews, have no definite general word for brother in
common use. But “kaikuaána” signifies any one of my
brothers, or male cousins, older than myself, I being a male,
and any one of my sisters, or female cousins, older than myself,
I being a female; whilst “kaikaina” signifies a younger brother
of a brother, or a younger sister of a sister.<a id="FNanchor_473_473" href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> Such distinguishing
epithets applied to older and younger are, in fact, very frequently
met with among uncivilized peoples. Thus, touching
the Andamanese, Mr. Man states that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> “brothers and sisters
speak of one another by titles that indicate relative age: that
is, their words for brother and sister involve the distinction of
elder or younger.” A like system is adopted by them in
respect to half-brothers, half-sisters, cousins, brothers-in-law,
and sisters-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_474_474" href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> In certain languages, too, there are special
terms for an uncle on the father’s side older than the father,
and for an uncle younger than he;<a id="FNanchor_475_475" href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> and in the Fulfúlde tongue,
the age of the uncles is so minutely specified, that the first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth uncle, on both the father’s and
the mother’s side, are each called by a particular name.<a id="FNanchor_476_476" href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></p>

<p>The wider meaning in which many terms for kinship are
used bear witness in the same direction. The Rev. J. Sibree
states that, in Hova, “ray,” father, does not take the sense the
corresponding word in many Semitic languages has, of “maker”
of a thing, but it is used in a wide sense as an elder or superior;
and “rény,” mother, is also used in a wide sense as a
respectful way of addressing an elderly woman.<a id="FNanchor_477_477" href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> Mr. Swann
writes to me that, among the Waguha, West Tanganyika, men
advanced in years are termed “baba,” father, whilst, in other
parts of Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Reade, old men are
addressed as “rera,” father, and old women as “ngwe,” mother.<a id="FNanchor_478_478" href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a>
The Russian “batushka” and “matushka,” as also the Swedish
“far” and “mor,” are often used in a similar way. Again,
Mr. Cousins asserts that, among the natives of Cis-Natalian
Kafirland, the terms for father, mother, brother, and sister,
are not restricted to them only, but are applied equally to
other persons of a similar age, whether related or otherwise.
“‘Bawo,’ father,” he says, “means elder or older, ‘bawo-kulu’
means a big-father, one older than father.” Probably “bawo,”
as belonging to the type “pa,” was originally used as a term
of address, from which the sense of elder or older was derived;
but this does not interfere with the matter in question. The
Rev. E. Casalis, writing of the Basutos, states that “in addressing
a person older than one’s self, one says, ‘My father,
my mother;’ to an equal, ‘My brother;’ and to inferiors, ‘My
children.’”<a id="FNanchor_479_479" href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> The Finnish “isä” and the Votyak “ai,” father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the Lappish “Aja,” and the Esthonian “äi,” grandfather, are
evidently related to, and probably the roots of, the Finnish
“iso” and “äijä” which mean big.<a id="FNanchor_480_480" href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> The Chukchi use,
besides “atta” for father and “mámang” for mother, “empynátchyo”
and “émpyngau” respectively, which obviously
have the same root as “émpytchin,” elder or older.<a id="FNanchor_481_481" href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> The
Brazilian Uainumá call a father “paii,” but also “pechyry,”
<i>i.e.</i>, old.<a id="FNanchor_482_482" href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> “Les jeunes Australiens,” says Bishop Salvado,
“ont coutume d’appeler ‘mama’ ou ‘maman’ (c’est-à-dire-père)
tous les vieillards, comme aussi ‘N-angan’ (ou mère) les femmes
avancées en âge.”<a id="FNanchor_483_483" href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> According to Nicolaus Damascenus, the
Galactophagi denominated “all old men fathers; young men,
sons; and those of equal age, brothers.”<a id="FNanchor_484_484" href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> In German, the
parents are “die Eltern,” the older (“die Aelteren”), and they
are also called familiarly “die Alten;” the father, “der Alte;”
and the mother, “die Alte” or “Altsche.”<a id="FNanchor_485_485" href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> Again, among
the North American Indians, old people are very commonly
named grandfathers and grandmothers;<a id="FNanchor_486_486" href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> whilst the Finnish
“ämmä” does not signify grandmother only, but old woman
in general.<a id="FNanchor_487_487" href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> Among the Tsuishikari Ainos, the maternal
grandfather and grandmother of a child are called both by
<i>him</i>, and his <i>father</i>, “henki” and “unarabe” respectively.<a id="FNanchor_488_488" href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>As to the collateral line, it should be observed that, in
Ćagatai, an elder sister is called “egeći,” which actually means
old woman “ege,” old, big; “eći,” woman, sister.<a id="FNanchor_489_489" href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> In
Hungarian, where “bátya” stands for elder brother, an uncle
is “nagybátya,” <i>i.e.</i>, a big elder brother.<a id="FNanchor_490_490" href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Among many Ural-Altaic
peoples, the same term is applied to an elder brother as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
to an uncle, to an elder sister as to an aunt.<a id="FNanchor_491_491" href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> Were we to
follow Mr. Morgan’s way of reasoning, we should, from this
nomenclature, come to very curious conclusions as to the early
marriage customs of the peoples in question.</p>

<p>Again, in the Galibi language of Brazil, “tigami” signifies
young brother, son, and little child indiscriminately;<a id="FNanchor_492_492" href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> and
several languages have no other words for son and daughter
than those for lad and girl.<a id="FNanchor_493_493" href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> Thus, in Hawaiian, a son is
called male child, or more properly, little male; and a daughter,
female child or girl.<a id="FNanchor_494_494" href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> Mr. George Bridgman states that,
among the Mackay blacks of Queensland, the word for daughter
is used by a man for any young woman belonging to the
class which his daughter would belong to if he had one.<a id="FNanchor_495_495" href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> And,
speaking of the South Australians, Eyre says, “In their intercourse
with each other, natives of different tribes are exceedingly
punctilious and polite; ... almost everything that is
said is prefaced by the appellation of father, son, brother,
mother, sister, or some other similar term, corresponding to
that degree of relationship which would have been most in
accordance with their relative ages and circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_496_496" href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></p>

<p>All those names, refer, as previously mentioned, not to the
absolute, but to the relative, age of the person addressed.
Often, too, there is a certain relativity in the use of words
denominating sex. Mr. Dall remarks, for instance, that among
the Eskimo, the form of the terms of relationship “appears to
depend in some cases more on the sex of the speaker than on
that of the person to whom the term refers.” In Eastern
Central Africa, “if a man have a brother and a sister, he is
called one thing by the brother, but quite a different thing by
the sister.”<a id="FNanchor_497_497" href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> And several other instances of the same kind
are to be found in Mr. Morgan’s tables.</p>

<p>As for the third factor influencing the terms of address—<i>i.e.</i>,
the social relationship which exists between the addresser and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the one addressed,—it is obvious that different designations are
applied to enemies and friends, to strangers and members of
the family-circle, nay, generally, to persons to whom one stands
in an altogether different external relationship. The importance
of this factor is evident from several statements. Thus,
among the Hovas, according to Mr. Sibree, the words for
brother and sister “are also used widely for any person whom
one meets and desires to act towards in a friendly manner.”<a id="FNanchor_498_498" href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a>
The Fuegians says Mr. Bridges, form certain kinds of friendships,
and “speak of aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins,
nieces and nephews, &amp;c., which are only so through the
friendships established.”<a id="FNanchor_499_499" href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> Among the Waguha, strangers are
called “ndugu,” brother, if of the same tribe;<a id="FNanchor_500_500" href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> and Mr. Hartshorne
tells us that the Veddahs applied to him the term “hura,”
or cousin.<a id="FNanchor_501_501" href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> We can understand, then, why the same name,
as a rule, is used by the savage to denote just the persons of
the same sex and of like age who belong to his own family-circle;
and why, as a consequence, the nomenclature is rich or
poor according as that circle is small or large. The Yahgans,
for instance, who live in families rather than in tribes, have a
very definite list of terms for kinsfolk. They have different
appellations for nephews and nieces on the brother’s side, and
nephews and nieces on the sister’s side, and their words for
uncle and aunt differ according as this relationship is paternal
or maternal. They have also special terms for father-, mother-,
son-and daughter-, brother-and sister-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_502_502" href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> On the other
hand, the larger, the body of kinsfolk that keep closely together,
and the less it is differentiated, as regards the functions of its
various members, the more comprehensive are generally the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
terms of address. The “classificatory system of relationship”
must, therefore, have emerged at a time when the separate
families had already united in larger bodies.</p>

<p>The same principle explains how it happens that a maternal
uncle is almost always distinguished from a father by a separate
term, whilst this is not the case with an uncle on the father’s
side, the former generally living in another community from
his nephew, and, besides, very frequently standing to him in a
quite peculiar relationship through the rules of succession. It
may be fairly assumed, too, that a mother’s sister much oftener
than a father’s sister is called a mother, because sisters, among
savages, keep as a rule, far more closely together, when married,
than brothers and sisters; sometimes even, especially among the
North American Indians, they are the wives of the same man.
If we add to this that a father’s brother’s son and a mother’s
sister’s son are more commonly addressed as brothers than as
father’s sister’s son and a mother’s brother’s son, it becomes
obvious to how great an extent the nomenclature is influenced
by external relations. But as a certain kind of external relationship
is invariably connected with a certain degree, or certain
degrees, of blood-relationship, the designations given with
reference to the former have been taken as terms for the
latter.</p>

<p>The basis on which Mr. Morgan has built his hypothesis
must be considered, then, altogether untenable.<a id="FNanchor_503_503" href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> It cannot
be proved that, where the “classificatory system” prevails,
the nomenclature was intended to express the degree of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>sanguity
so exactly as he assumes, or that it had originally
anything whatever to do with descent. On the contrary, I
have endeavoured to show that the case was probably just the
reverse; so that no inference regarding early marriage customs
is to be drawn from the terms for relationships. Even now,
in Spanish, a brother’s great-grandson is called grandson;
in Bulgarian, as also in Russian, a father’s father’s brother is
termed a grandfather, and a father’s father’s sister a grandmother;
the Greek “ἁνεψιός” appears to have been applied to
a nephew, a grandson, and a cousin; “neef,” in Dutch, still
expresses these three relationships indiscriminately; in Flemish
and Platt Deutsch, “nichte” is applied to a female cousin as
well as to a niece; and Shakspeare, in his will, describes his
granddaughter, Susannah Hall, as “my niece.”<a id="FNanchor_504_504" href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> Surely,
nobody would look upon these designations as relics of ancient
times, when there really might have been some uncertainty as
to kinship in the direction which the terms indicate. Mr.
Morgan himself admits that, in Latin, “nepos” did not originally
signify “either a nephew, grandson or cousin, but that
it was used promiscuously to designate a class of persons next
without the primary relationships.”<a id="FNanchor_505_505" href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thirty years ago, in a work of prodigious learning,<a id="FNanchor_506_506" href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> the
Swiss jurist, Dr. Bachofen, drew attention to the remarkable
fact that a system of “kinship through mothers only” prevailed
among several ancient peoples. Moreover, partly
from actual statements of old writers, partly from traditions
and myths, he came to the conclusion that such a system
everywhere preceded the rise of “kinship through males.” A
few years later, though quite independently of him, Mr.
McLennan set forth exactly the same hypothesis, being led
to it chiefly by extensive studies in modern ethnology.
While, however, Bachofen explained the phenomenon as a
consequence of the supremacy of women, Mr. McLennan
regarded it as due to the uncertain paternity which resulted
from early promiscuity. “It is inconceivable,” he says, “that
anything but the want of certainty on that point could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
have long prevented the acknowledgment of kinship through
males; and in such cases we shall be able to conclude that
such certainty has formerly been wanting—that more or less
promiscuous intercourse between the sexes has formerly
prevailed. The connection between these two things—uncertain
paternity and kinship through females only, seems
so necessary—that of cause and effect—that we may confidently
infer the one where we find the other.”<a id="FNanchor_507_507" href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a></p>

<p>It must be observed that the facts adduced as examples of
what Mr. McLennan calls “kinship through females only” in
most instances imply, chiefly, that children are named after
their mothers, not after their fathers, and that property and
rank succeed exclusively in the female line. If these customs
were to be explained as relics of ancient promiscuity, we
certainly should have to admit that such a state was formerly
very prevalent in the human race. Yet we could not be sure
that it prevailed universally. For, though the number of
peoples among whom descent and inheritance follow the
mother’s side only, is very considerable,<a id="FNanchor_508_508" href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> the number of those
among whom the male line is recognized, is scarcely less—even
apart from the civilized nations of Europe and Asia.
At present, when anthropologists affirm with so much assurance
that a system of exclusive “kinship through females”
prevailed everywhere before the tie of blood between father
and child had found a place in systems of relationships, it
seems appropriate to give a list of peoples among whom such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
a system does <i>not</i> prevail—a list, however, which cannot
pretend to completeness.</p>

<p>Starting, then, with North America, which is acknowledged
to be, or to have been, one of the chief centres of “mother-right,”
or metrocracy, we meet there with many aboriginal
nations among whom a son, as a rule takes the father’s name
and becomes his heir.<a id="FNanchor_509_509" href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> Thus Cranz states that, among the
Eskimo of Greenland, “when a husband dies, his eldest son
inherits his house, tent, and woman’s boat, and besides must
maintain the mother and children, who share the furniture
and clothes amongst themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_510_510" href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> Among the Indians
bordering on the south-east coast of the river St. Lawrence,
according to Heriot, the eldest son took the name of his
father with the addition of one syllable.<a id="FNanchor_511_511" href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> The Californian
tribes<a id="FNanchor_512_512" href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> and the Dacotahs<a id="FNanchor_513_513" href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> recognized chieftainship as hereditary
in the male line; and, with reference to the latter, Mr.
Prescott remarks that they cannot well forget relationships,
as the names of father and mother are both recollected for
three or four generations.<a id="FNanchor_514_514" href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> Among the Ahts, the eldest son
takes all the property left by his father, and the head-chiefs
rank is hereditary in the male line.<a id="FNanchor_515_515" href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> The paternal system
prevails, moreover, in thirteen other tribes mentioned by Mr.
Frazer in his essay on “Totemism.”<a id="FNanchor_516_516" href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></p>

<p>In Mexico, Yucatan, San Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua,
succession ran from father to son; and in Vera Paz,
according to Las Casas, kinship was so exclusively recognized
in the male line, that the people there thought the most
remote kin in their own lineage to be more closely related
than the daughter of their mother, provided she was not
of the same father. On the other hand, Piedrahita tells us
that, among the Chibchas, the sons of sisters, and, in default
of such, the brothers of the king, were the heirs to the
crown of Bogota, but that the sons had a right to the personal
property of their father; whilst, according to Herrera, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
property was inherited by the brothers, and if there were none
living, by the <i>sons</i> of those who were dead.<a id="FNanchor_517_517" href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></p>

<p>Among the Caribs, kinship was reckoned in the female line,
but the authority of the chiefs was hereditary in the male line
only, the children of sisters being excluded from the succession.<a id="FNanchor_518_518" href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a>
Among the Macas Indians in Ecuador, property
descends from father to son;<a id="FNanchor_519_519" href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> among the Guaycurûs, Abipones,
and Araucanians, nobility, or chieftainship, was hereditary
in the male line;<a id="FNanchor_520_520" href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> and the Brazilian aborigines, or at
least some of them, laid particular stress upon kinship through
fathers.<a id="FNanchor_521_521" href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> Again, with reference to the Yahgans of Tierra del
Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes, “A child belongs equally to the
clan of its father and mother as regards duty of revenge, but
is always reckoned a member of the father’s clan only.
Children are generally named after their grandparents,
paternal or maternal indifferently. They are quite as much
attached to their mother’s relatives and these to them, as to
their paternal relatives; the only difference is that they are
integral parts of the father’s clan, not of the mother’s.”
Speaking of the same people, M. Hyades remarks, “L’héritage
se transmet à l’époux survivant, ou à défaut, au fils aîné.”<a id="FNanchor_522_522" href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a>
In short, the paternal system, so far as we know, predominates
among the aborigines of South America.</p>

<p>Passing to the Pacific Islands, we find that, though rank
and clan are commonly inherited there through the mother,
property generally goes in the male line. In Tonga, the son
succeeds his father in homage and title,<a id="FNanchor_523_523" href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> and here, as well as
in Fiji, on the father’s death, his possessions descend to his
children.<a id="FNanchor_524_524" href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> Ellis tells us that, in Tahiti, the child of a chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
was invested, soon after its birth, with the name and office of
its father,<a id="FNanchor_525_525" href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> and in the case of there being no children, the
brother of the deceased assumed the government. In other
families property always went to the eldest son.<a id="FNanchor_526_526" href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> Among
the Hawaiians, the rank of the principal and inferior chiefs,
the offices of the priests, as also other situations of honour
and influence, descended from father to son,<a id="FNanchor_527_527" href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> although on
the whole, the female line predominated.<a id="FNanchor_528_528" href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> In the Hervey
Islands, children belonged either to the father’s or mother’s
clan, according to arrangement; usually, however, the father
had the preference.<a id="FNanchor_529_529" href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> In New Caledonia, kinship is reckoned
in the male line,<a id="FNanchor_530_530" href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> and in Lifu, as Mr. Radfield informs me,
children belong to the paternal clan. In the Caroline Group,
landed property succeeds mostly from father to son, children
are named after their father’s father or mother’s father, and,
apparently, the rank of the father influences that of the son,
at least if he be a chief.<a id="FNanchor_531_531" href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> Among the Rejangs<a id="FNanchor_532_532" href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> and Bataks<a id="FNanchor_533_533" href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a>
of Sumatra, as also in several other islands belonging to the
Indian Archipelago,<a id="FNanchor_534_534" href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> and in New Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_535_535" href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> the male line
prevails. In the Kingsmill Islands, “if a chief has several
children by different wives, the son of the mother of the
highest rank is the successor.”<a id="FNanchor_536_536" href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> And, in New Zealand,
nobility was inherited both in the male and female line; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
on the death of a man, his eldest son took the family name
which his father had held before him.<a id="FNanchor_537_537" href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></p>

<p>Australian children are generally named after their mother’s
clan; but this is not the case in every tribe.<a id="FNanchor_538_538" href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> Among the
Gournditch-mara, Turra, Moncalon, Torndirrup, and some
other tribes, the male line prevails.<a id="FNanchor_539_539" href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> With reference to the
Narrinyeri, the Rev. G. Taplin states that a man’s children
belong to his tribe (<i>i.e.</i> clan), and not to their mother’s; that
property descends from father to son, and that, in case of a
man dying without issue of his own, his possessions are always
transmitted to the brother’s children.<a id="FNanchor_540_540" href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> Again, in the Dieyerie
tribe of South Australia, the sons take the father’s clan, the
daughters the mother’s.<a id="FNanchor_541_541" href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Even where children are named
after their mother, inheritance may go from father to son.
Thus, among the West Australians, the hunting ground or
landed property descends in the male line, though “children
of either sex always take the family name of their mother.”<a id="FNanchor_542_542" href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a></p>

<p>Among the Todas, all children belong to the father’s
family, and inheritance runs through males only.<a id="FNanchor_543_543" href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> The same
is the case with most of the Indian Hill Tribes: either all the
sons dividing their father’s property equally, as among the
Gonds, Bodo, and Dhimáls; or the eldest son getting the
largest share, as among the Kandhs, Karens, and Nagas; or
the youngest born male being the only heir, as among the
Hos; or the favourite son succeeding without reference to
age, as among the Mishmis.<a id="FNanchor_544_544" href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> Among the Pahárias, too, sons
inherit, and nephews by sisters get no share.<a id="FNanchor_545_545" href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> The law of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
succession among the Singphos gives to the eldest son all the
landed property of the father, to the youngest all his personal
property, while the rest inherit nothing.<a id="FNanchor_546_546" href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> Among the
Santals, children belong to the father’s clan;<a id="FNanchor_547_547" href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> and the same
is the case with the offspring of intermarriages of Lepchas
and Limbus and Butias.<a id="FNanchor_548_548" href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> Touching the Karens, Dr. A.
Bunker writes to me, “A child takes a name of its own,
and of neither of the parents; but usually the father, being
the stronger, takes the child in case of separation. It is
regarded as belonging to both parents, so far as blood goes.”
If we add to this that the male line prevails in Arabia,<a id="FNanchor_549_549" href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>
Tibet,<a id="FNanchor_550_550" href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> throughout Russian Asia,<a id="FNanchor_551_551" href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> and among the Ainos,<a id="FNanchor_552_552" href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> it
must be admitted that the system of “kinship through females
only” is of very rare occurrence in Asia, being restricted, so
far as I know, to a few parts of India, Ceylon, and the
Malay Archipelago.<a id="FNanchor_553_553" href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></p>

<p>It is much more prevalent among the African races. Yet,
even among them, there are many instances where succession
runs in the male line. A king or chief of the Somals<a id="FNanchor_554_554" href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> and
Ba-kwileh<a id="FNanchor_555_555" href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> is succeeded by his son. Among the Fulah, this
dignity is transmitted to the brother, while, in other instances,
succession goes from father to son.<a id="FNanchor_556_556" href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> Among the Negroes of
the Gold Coast, according to Bosman, the eldest son succeeded
his father in office, though kinship was reckoned through the
mother all along this coast, except at Accra.<a id="FNanchor_557_557" href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> Dr. A. Sims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
writes that, among the Bateke, “the child is considered as
belonging to the father and mother equally,” and takes the
grandfather’s or grandmother’s name. Among the Waguha,
according to Mr. Swann, children are generally named after
the father. In Lánda, the eldest son inherits all his father’s
possessions, wives included.<a id="FNanchor_558_558" href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> Among the Damaras, whose
divisions into clans are derived from the mother, the
eldest son of the chief wife, nevertheless, is the successor
of his father;<a id="FNanchor_559_559" href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> and the same rule prevails among the Bechuanas.<a id="FNanchor_560_560" href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a>
The Rev. A. Eyles states that all Zulu children
belong to the father’s tribe, and are called by his name or
by the name of some of his ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_561_561" href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> According to Mr.
Cousins,<a id="FNanchor_562_562" href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> this is essentially true of various Kafir tribes, the
first son, however, never being named after the grandfather,
but always after the father. Warner, Brownlee, and E.  v.
Weber assert also that, among the people, inheritance passes
from father to son.<a id="FNanchor_563_563" href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> Le Vaillant and Kolben state the same
with reference to the Hottentots and Bushmans;<a id="FNanchor_564_564" href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> and Andersson
affirms that, among the Namaquas, daughters take
the father’s name, sons the mother’s.<a id="FNanchor_565_565" href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> Finally, in the part of
Madagascar where Drury was, kinship does not seem to
have been, in every case, reckoned through the female, though
in that island children generally follow the condition of
the mother.<a id="FNanchor_566_566" href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></p>

<p>As for ancient peoples, Bachofen has adduced from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
works of classical writers evidence for the uterine line having
prevailed among several of them. But, to quote Sir Henry
Maine, “the greatest races of mankind, when they first appear
to us, show themselves at or near a stage of development in
which relationship or kinship is reckoned exclusively through
males.”<a id="FNanchor_567_567" href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> Several writers have, it is true, endeavoured to prove
that, among the primitive Aryans, descent was traced through
females only;<a id="FNanchor_568_568" href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> but the evidence does not seem to be conclusive.
Much importance has been attributed to the specially
close connection which, according to Tacitus, existed between
a sister’s children and their mother’s brothers;<a id="FNanchor_569_569" href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> but
Dr. Schrader observes that, in spite of this prominent position
of the maternal uncle in the ancient Teutonic family, the
<i>patruus</i> distinctly came before the <i>avunculus</i>, the agnates
before the cognates, in testamentary succession. He also
suggests that, when the head of a household died, the women
of his family passed under the guardianship of the eldest
son, and that a woman’s children had therefore, quite naturally,
a peculiarly intimate relation to their maternal uncle.<a id="FNanchor_570_570" href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a>
It is safe to say with Professor Max Müller, that we can
neither assert nor deny that in unknown times the Aryans
ever passed through a metrocratic stage.<a id="FNanchor_571_571" href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></p>

<p>Even if it could be proved—which is doubtful—that, in
former times, a system of “kinship through females only,” fully
developed, prevailed among all the peoples whose children take
the mother’s name and are considered to belong to her clan,
though succession runs in the male line, we should still have to
account for the fact that a large number of peoples exhibit no
traces of such a system.<a id="FNanchor_572_572" href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> And to them belong many of the
rudest races of the world—such as the aborigines of Brazil, the
Fuegians, Hottentots, Bushmans, and several very low tribes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Australia and India. The inference that “kinship through
females only” has everywhere preceded the rise of “kinship
through males,” would, then, be warranted only on condition
that the cause, or the causes, to which the maternal system is
owing, could be proved to have operated universally in the
past life of mankind. From Mr. McLennan’s point of view,
such an inference would be inadmissible, as he cannot prove
the former occurrence of a universal stage of promiscuity or
polyandry, leading to uncertain paternity—the cause to which
he attributes that system.</p>

<p>Yet it is far from being so inconceivable as Mr. McLennan
assumes, that “anything but the want of certainty on that
point could have long prevented the acknowledgment of kinship
through males.”<a id="FNanchor_573_573" href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> Paternity, as Sir Henry Maine
remarks, is “matter of inference, as opposed to maternity,
which is matter of observation.”<a id="FNanchor_574_574" href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> Hence it is almost
beyond doubt that the father’s participation in parentage was
not recognized as soon as the mother’s.<a id="FNanchor_575_575" href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> Now, however, there
does not seem to be a single people which has not made the
discovery of fatherhood. In reply to my question whether
the Fuegians consider a child to descend exclusively or predominantly
from either of the parents, Mr. Bridges certainly
writes that, according to his idea, they “consider the maternal
tie much more important than the paternal, and the duties
connected with it of mutual help, defence, and vengeance are
held very sacred.” But it is doubtful whether this refers to
the mere physiological connection between the child and
its parents. Dr. Sims informs me that, among the Bateke,
the function of both parents in generation is held alike important,
and the Waguha of West Tanganyika, as Mr. Swann
states, also recognize the part taken by both. The same is
asserted by Archdeacon Hodgson concerning certain other
tribes of Eastern Central Africa, though, among them,
children take the name of the mother’s tribe. Again, the
Naudowessies, according to Carver, had the very curious idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
that their offspring were indebted to their father for their souls,
the invisible part of their essence, and to the mother for their
corporeal and visible part; hence they considered it “more
rational that they should be distinguished by the name of the
latter, from whom they indubitably derive their being, than
by that of the father, to which a doubt might sometimes arise
whether they are justly entitled.”<a id="FNanchor_576_576" href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Moreover, it seems as if
the father’s share in parentage, once discovered, was often
exaggerated. Thus, referring to some tribes of New South
Wales, Mr. Cameron tells us that, although the father has
nothing to do with the disposal of his daughter, as she
belongs to the clan of her mother’s brother, they “believe
that the daughter emanates from her father solely, being only
nutured by her mother.”<a id="FNanchor_577_577" href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> Indeed, Mr. Howitt has found in
every Australian tribe, without exception, with which he has
acquaintance, the idea that the child is derived from the male
parent only. As a black fellow once put it to him, “The man
gives the child to a woman to take care of for him, and he
can do whatever he likes with his own child.”<a id="FNanchor_578_578" href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> Again, Mr.
Cousins writes that, according to Kaffir ideas, a child descends
chiefly, though not exclusively, from the father; and the
ancient Greeks, as well as the Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_579_579" href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> and Hindus,<a id="FNanchor_580_580" href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a>
maintained a similar view. Nay, Euripides states distinctly
that, in his day, the universally accepted physiological
doctrine recognized only the share taken by the father in
procreation, and Hippocrates, in combating this opinion, and
contending that the child descended from both parents, seems
to admit that it was a prevalent heresy.<a id="FNanchor_581_581" href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> Finally, it seems
probable that the custom known under the name of “La
Couvade”—that is, the odd rule, prevalent among several
peoples in different parts of the world, requiring that the
father, at the birth of his child, shall retire to bed for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
time, and fast or abstain from certain kinds of food—implies
some idea of relationship between the two.<a id="FNanchor_582_582" href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a></p>

<p>Admitting, however, that there was a time when fatherhood,
in the physiological sense of the term, was not discovered,
I do not think that the preference given to the
female line is due to this fact. If the denomination of
children and the rules of succession really were in the first
place dependent on ideas of consanguinity, it might be
expected that a change with reference to the latter would
be followed by a change in the former respect also. But the
ties of blood have exercised a far less direct influence on the
matter in question than is generally supposed, the system of
“kinship through females only” being, properly speaking,
quite different from what the words imply.</p>

<p>There may be several reasons for naming children after
the mother rather than after the father, apart from any
consideration of relationship. Especially among savages,
the tie between a mother and child is much stronger than
that which binds a child to the father.<a id="FNanchor_583_583" href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> Not only has she
given birth to it, but she has also for years been seen
carrying it about at her breast. Moreover, in cases of separation,
occurring frequently at lower stages of civilization,
the infant children always follow the mother, and so, very
often, do the children more advanced in years. Is it not
natural, then, that they should keep the name of the mother
rather than that of a father whom they scarcely know? Mr.
Belt tells us that the men and women even of the christianised
lower classes of Nicaragua often change their mates, and
the children, in such cases remaining with the mother, take
their surname from her.<a id="FNanchor_584_584" href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> According to Swann, the Creeks
conferred the honour of a chief on the issue of the female line,
because it was impossible to trace the right by the male issue,
women only exceptionally having more than two children by
the same father.<a id="FNanchor_585_585" href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> And touching the Khasias, one of the few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
tribes in India among whom the female line prevails, Dr.
Hooker states that they have a very lax idea of marriage,
divorce and exchange of wives being common and attended
with no disgrace; “the son therefore often forgets his father’s
name and person before he grows up, but becomes strongly
attached to his mother.”<a id="FNanchor_586_586" href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>Speaking of certain negro tribes, Winterbottom suggested
long ago that the prevalence of the female line was to be
explained by the practice of polygyny,<a id="FNanchor_587_587" href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> and Dr. Starcke has
recently called attention to the same point.<a id="FNanchor_588_588" href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> The Rev. D.
Macdonald likewise remarks, in his account of the Efatese
of the New Hebrides, that the idea that children are more
closely related to the mother than to the father is an idea
perfectly natural among a polygynous people.<a id="FNanchor_589_589" href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> It is a
customary arrangement in polygynous families that each wife
has a hut for herself, where she lives with her children; but
even where this is not the case, mother and children naturally
keep together as a little sub-family. No wonder, then,
if a child takes its name after the mother rather than
after the father. This is the simplest way of pointing
out the distinction between the issue of different wives, a
distinction which is of special importance where it is accompanied
by different privileges as to succession. It is worth
noticing that, among the Negroes, who are probably the most
polygynous race in the world, the female line is extremely
prevalent; whereas, among the Hill Tribes of India, who are
on the whole, monogamists, children, with few exceptions,
take the name of the father. With reference to the Basutos,
a Bechuana tribe, Mr. Casalis observes that the authority of
the eldest maternal uncle preponderates to excess, especially
in polygynous families, where the children have no strong
affection for their father.<a id="FNanchor_590_590" href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Further, among several peoples a man, on marrying, has to
quit his home, and go to live with his wife in the house of
her father, of whose family he becomes a member. This is a
common practice among several of the North American tribes,<a id="FNanchor_591_591" href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a>
and prevailed, in the southern part of the New World, among
the Caribs.<a id="FNanchor_592_592" href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> In some parts of Eastern Central Africa, also,
a man who marries a full grown girl “immediately leaves his
own village and proceeds to build a house in the village of
his wife.”<a id="FNanchor_593_593" href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> Among the Sengirese, according to Dr. Hickson,
the man always goes to his wife’s house, unless he be the son
of a rajah, in which case he may do as he pleases.<a id="FNanchor_594_594" href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Dr. Hooker
tells us that, among the Khasias, “the husband does not
take his wife home, but enters her father’s household, and is
entertained there.”<a id="FNanchor_595_595" href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> And in Sumatra, in the mode of marriage
called “ambel anak,” the father of a virgin makes
choice of some young man for her husband, who is taken
into his house to live there in a state between that of a son
and that of a debtor.<a id="FNanchor_596_596" href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a></p>

<p>According to Dr. Starcke, this custom is due to the great
cohesive power of the several families, which causes them to
refuse to part with any of their members. “Since men are
more independent,” he says, “they are also less stationary;
they can no longer attract the women to themselves, and are
therefore attracted by them.<a id="FNanchor_597_597" href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> Under such circumstances,
there is nothing astonishing in the fact that children are
named after the mother’s tribe or clan, which is the case in
all the instances just given of peoples among whom the
husband has to settle down with his father-in-law. Indeed,
Dr. Tylor has found that, whilst the number of coincidences
between peoples among whom the husband lives with the
wife’s family and peoples among whom the maternal system
prevails, is proportionally large, the full maternal system never
appears among peoples whose exclusive custom is for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
husband to take his wife to his own home.<a id="FNanchor_598_598" href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> And it is a
remarkable fact that where both customs—the woman receiving
her husband in her own hut, and the man taking his
wife to his—occur side by side among the same people, descent
in the former cases is traced through the mother, in the latter
through the father.<a id="FNanchor_599_599" href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> In Japan, should there be only daughters
in the family, a husband is procured for the eldest, who enters
his wife’s family, and, at the same time, takes its name.<a id="FNanchor_600_600" href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a></p>

<p>Again, as to the rules of succession, Dr. Starcke has set
forth the hypothesis that they are dependent on local
connections, those persons being each other’s heirs who dwell
together in one place. Among the Iroquois, for instance, at
the death of a man, his property is divided among his
brothers, sisters, and mother’s brothers, whilst the property of
a woman is transmitted to her children and sisters, but not to
her brothers. “Owing to the faculty of memory,” Dr.
Starcke says, “childhood and youth involve a young man in
such a web of associations that he afterwards finds it hard to
detach himself from them. The man who, when married,
has lived as a stranger in the house of another, clings to the
impressions of his former home, and his earlier household
companions become his heirs. But the brother who has
wandered elsewhere stands in a more remote relation to his
sister than do the sisters and the children living with her in
the parental home, and he is therefore excluded from the
inheritance.”<a id="FNanchor_601_601" href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></p>

<p>Though agreeing, in the main, with Dr. Starcke’s hypothesis,
I do not think it affords a complete explanation of the
matter. It certainly accounts for the fact that, under the
maternal system, it is just the nearest relatives on the mother’s
side who are a man’s heirs, to the exclusion of other members
of the clan. But, if succession really depended upon local
relations only, or upon the remembrance of such relations in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the past, it would be the most natural arrangement, where
father and children lived together till the latter were grown
up, for the father to be succeeded by his son. It seems
probable that the causes which make children take their
mother’s name, have also directly exercised some influence
upon the rules of succession; but I am inclined to believe
that the power of the name itself has been of the highest
importance in that respect.</p>

<p>By means of family names former connections are kept
up, and the past is associated with the present. Even we
ourselves are generally more disposed to count kin with
distant relatives having our own surname than with those
having another. And upon man in a savage state language
exercises, in this matter, a much greater influence than upon
us. With reference to the aborigines of Western Australia,
Sir George Grey observes, “Obligations of family names are
much stronger than those of blood;” and a “Saurian,” or a
“Serpent,” from the East considers himself related to a
“Saurian,” or a “Serpent,” from the West, though no such
relationship may exist.<a id="FNanchor_602_602" href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> Among the Ossetes, according to
Baron von Haxthausen, a man is considered more nearly
related to a cousin a hundred times removed, who bears his
name, than to his mother’s brother; and he is bound to take
blood revenge for the former, while the latter is in fact not
regarded as a relative at all.<a id="FNanchor_603_603" href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> Speaking of certain Bantu
tribes, Mr. McCall Theal remarks that their aversion to incestuous
marriages is so strong, that a man will not marry
a girl who belongs to another tribe, if she has the same
family name as himself, although the relationship cannot be
traced.<a id="FNanchor_604_604" href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Is it not a justifiable presumption that a similar
association of ideas has influenced the rules of succession
also,—all the more so, where community of name implies
community of worship as well? It should be observed that
in every case—at least so far as I know—where rank and
property are inherited through females only, children are
named after the mother,—but not <i>vice versa</i>, thanks to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
direct influence of local and other connections. In China, a
man is even strictly forbidden to nominate as his heir an
individual of a different surname.<a id="FNanchor_605_605" href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></p>

<p>It is a difficult, sometimes even a hopeless, task to try to
find out the origin of savage laws and customs, and I do not
pretend to have given an exhaustive explanation of those in
question. But it seems to be sufficiently clear, from what
has been said, that we have no right to ascribe them to
uncertain paternity; nay, that such an assumption is not even
probably true. No one has yet exhibited any general coincidence
of what we consider moral and immoral habits with
the prevalence of the male and female line among existing
savages. Among the Barea, for instance, as among the
Negroes of Loango, inheritance goes through mothers only,
though adultery is said to be extremely rare;<a id="FNanchor_606_606" href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> whilst, on the
other hand, among the wanton natives of Tahiti, possessions
always descend to the eldest son. With the Todas and
Tibetans, among whom paternity is often actually uncertain
on account of their polyandrous marriage customs, succession
runs through the male line only. “If one or more women,”
Mr. Marshall says with reference to the former, “are in common
to several men, each husband considers all the children
as his—though each woman is mother only to her own—and
each male child is an heir to the property of all of the
fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_607_607" href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> Among the Reddies, a son—although it often happens
that he does not know his real father—is the heir of his
mother’s husband.<a id="FNanchor_608_608" href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> And, in India and Ceylon, female kinship
is associated with polyandry of the <i>beena</i> type—where the
husbands come to live with the wife in or near the house of
her birth; and male kinship with that of the <i>deega</i> type—where
the wife goes to live in the house and village of her husband.<a id="FNanchor_609_609" href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></p>

<p>Lastly, as Mr. Spencer remarks, avowed recognition of
kinship in the female line only, shows by no means an unconsciousness
of male kinship. As a proof of this may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
adduced the converse custom which the early Romans had of
recognizing no legal relationship between children of the
same mother and of different fathers. For, if it cannot be
supposed that an actual unconsciousness of motherhood was
associated with this system, neither is there any adequate
warrant for the supposition that actual unconsciousness of
fatherhood was associated with the system of “kinship
through females only” among savages.<a id="FNanchor_610_610" href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">610</a></p>

<p>The prevalence of the female line would not presuppose
general promiscuity even if, in some cases, it were dependent
on uncertainty as to fathers.<a id="FNanchor_611_611" href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> The separation of
husband and wife, adultery on the woman’s side, and the
practice of lending wives to visitors occurring very frequently
among many savage nations, the proverb which says, “It is
a wise child that knows his own father,” holds true for a large
number of them. According to Mr. Ingham, the Bakongo,
who trace their descent through the mother only, assert as a
reason for this custom uncertain paternity; but nevertheless,
as we have already seen, they would be horrified at the idea
of promiscuous intercourse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having now examined all the groups of social phenomena
adduced as evidence for the hypothesis of promiscuity, we
have found that, in point of fact, they are no evidence.
Not one of the customs alleged as relics of an ancient state
of indiscriminate cohabitation of the sexes, or “communal
marriage,” presupposes the former existence of that state.
The numerous facts put forward in support of the hypothesis
do not entitle us to assume that promiscuity has ever been
the prevailing form of sexual relations among a single people,
far less that it has constituted a general stage in the social
development of man, and, least of all, that such a stage
formed the starting-point of all human history.</p>

<p>It may seem to the reader that this question has received
more attention than it deserves. But I have discussed it so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
fully not only because of the importance of the subject, but
because of the insight the customs mentioned give us into
sexual and family relations very different from our own, and
because the unscientific character of the conclusions we have
tested shows most clearly that sociology is still a science in
its infancy.</p>

<p>Even now my criticism is not finished. Having shown that
the hypothesis of promiscuity has no foundation in fact, I
shall endeavour, in the next chapter, to demonstrate that it
is opposed to all the correct ideas we are able to form with
regard to the early condition of man.</p>

<small>A CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Concluded</i>)</p>


<p>Against the hypothesis of promiscuity Sir Henry Maine
has urged that a good deal of evidence seems to show that
promiscuous intercourse between the sexes tends to a pathological
condition very unfavourable to fecundity; and “infecundity,
amid perpetually belligerent savages, implies
weakness and ultimate destruction.”<a id="FNanchor_612_612" href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a></p>

<p>Dr. Carpenter refers to the efforts of the American
planters to form the negroes into families, as the promiscuity
into which they were liable to fall produced infertility, and
fertility had become important to the slave-owners through
the prohibition of the slave-trade.<a id="FNanchor_613_613" href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> It is also a well-known
fact that prostitutes very seldom have children, while, according
to Dr. Roubaud, those of them who marry young easily
become mothers.<a id="FNanchor_614_614" href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> “Il ne pousse pas d’herbe dans les chemins
où tout le monde passe,” Dr. Bertillon remarks.<a id="FNanchor_615_615" href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> And, in a
community where all the women equally belonged to all the
men, the younger and prettier ones would of course be most
sought after, and take up a position somewhat akin to that
of the prostitutes of modern society.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be urged that the practice of polyandry
prevails among several peoples without any evil results as
regards fecundity being heard of. But polyandry scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
ever implies continued promiscuous intercourse of many
men with one woman. In Tibet, for example, where the
brothers of a family very often have a common wife, more
than one are seldom at home at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_616_616" href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> Mr. Talboys
Wheeler has even suggested that polyandry arose among a
pastoral people, whose men were away from their families
for months at a time, so that the duty of protecting these
families would naturally be undertaken by the brothers in
turn.<a id="FNanchor_617_617" href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> Again, among the Kaniagmuts, the second husband was
only a deputy who acted as husband and master of the house
during the absence of the true lord;<a id="FNanchor_618_618" href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> and the same was the
case in Nukahiva.<a id="FNanchor_619_619" href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> But especially remarkable is the following
practice connected with polyandry. In the description
given by Bontier and Le Verrier of the conquest and conversion
of the Canarians in 1402 by Jean de Bethencourt we
read that, in the island of Lancerote, most of the women
have three husbands, “who wait upon them alternately by
months; the husband that is to live with the wife the following
month waits upon her and upon her other husband the whole
of the month that the latter has her, and so each takes her in
turn.”<a id="FNanchor_620_620" href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> Mr. Harkness tells us about a Toda who, having
referred to his betrothal to his wife Pilluvāni and the
subsequent betrothal of the latter to two others, Khakhood
and Tūmbut, said, “Now, according to our customs,
Pilluvāni was to pass the first month with me, the second with
Khakhood, and the third with Tūmbut.”<a id="FNanchor_621_621" href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> Among the Kulus,
in the Himalaya Mountains, when parents sell a daughter to
several brothers, she belongs during the first month to the
eldest brother, during the second to the next eldest, and so on;<a id="FNanchor_622_622" href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>
whilst, as regards the Nairs, whose women, except those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
first quality, may marry twelve husbands if they pleased.
Hamilton states that “all the husbands agree very well, for
they cohabit with her in their turns, according to their priority
of marriage, ten days, more or less, according as they can fix
a term among themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_623_623" href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The strongest argument against ancient promiscuity is,
however, to be derived from the psychical nature of man and
other mammals. Mr. Darwin remarks that from what we
know of the jealousy of all male quadrupeds, armed, as
many of them are, with special weapons for battling with
their rivals, promiscuous intercourse is utterly unlikely to prevail
in a state of nature. “Therefore,” he continues, “looking
far enough back in the stream of time, and judging from
the social habits of man as he now exists, the most probable
view is that he aboriginally lived in small communities,
each with a single wife, or if powerful with several, whom he
jealously guarded against all other men.”<a id="FNanchor_624_624" href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> Yet, according
to the same naturalist, it seems certain, from the lines of
evidence afforded by Mr. Morgan, Mr. McLennan, and Sir J.
Lubbock, that almost promiscuous intercourse at a later time
was extremely common throughout the world;<a id="FNanchor_625_625" href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> and a similar
view is held by some other writers.<a id="FNanchor_626_626" href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> But if jealousy can be
proved to be universally prevalent in the human race at the
present day, it is impossible to believe that there ever was a
time when man was devoid of that powerful feeling. Professor
Giraud-Teulon<a id="FNanchor_627_627" href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> and Dr. Le Bon<a id="FNanchor_628_628" href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> assert, indeed, that it is
unknown among almost all civilized peoples; but this assertion
will be found to be groundless.</p>

<p>Starting from the very lowest races of men: we are told
that the Fuegians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> “are exceedingly jealous of their women,
and will not allow any one, if they can help it, to enter their
huts, particularly boys.”<a id="FNanchor_629_629" href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> Several writers assert the same as
regards the Australians.<a id="FNanchor_630_630" href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> Thus, according to Sir George
Grey, “a stern and vigilant jealousy is commonly felt by every
married man;”<a id="FNanchor_631_631" href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> and Mr. Curr states that, in most tribes,
a woman “is not allowed to converse or have any relations
whatever with any adult male, save her husband. Even with
a grown-up brother she is always forbidden to exchange a
word.”<a id="FNanchor_632_632" href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> With reference to the Veddahs of Ceylon, Mr.
Bailey says that, with the very smallest cause, the men are
exceedingly jealous of their most unattractive wives, and are
very careful to keep them apart from their companions.<a id="FNanchor_633_633" href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></p>

<p>According to a Thlinket myth, the jealousy of man is
older than the world itself. There was an age, it is supposed,
when men groped in the dark in search of the world. At
that time a Thlinket lived who had a wife and sister; and
he was so jealous of his wife, that he killed all his sister’s
children because they looked at her.<a id="FNanchor_634_634" href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a></p>

<p>Great jealousy is met with among the Atkha Aleuts,
according to Father Yakof; among the Kutchin Indians,
according to Richardson and Hardisty; among the Haidahs,
according to Dixon; among the Tacullis, according to
Harmon; among the Crees, according to Richardson.<a id="FNanchor_635_635" href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> The
Indians on the Eastern side of the Rocky Mountains visited
by Harmon, in their fits of jealousy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> “often cut off all the hair
from the heads of their wives, and, not unfrequently, cut off
their noses also; and should they not in the moment of
passion have a knife at hand, they will snap it off at one bite,
with their teeth.... The man is satisfied in thus revenging a
supposed injury; and having destroyed the beauty of his
wife, he concludes that he has secured her against all future
solicitations to offend.”<a id="FNanchor_636_636" href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> In California, if a married native
woman is seen even walking in the forest with another man
than her husband, she is chastised by him, whilst a repetition
of the offence is generally punished with speedy death.<a id="FNanchor_637_637" href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">637</a>
Among the Creeks, “it was formerly reckoned adultery, if
a man took a pitcher of water off a married woman’s head,
and drank of it.”<a id="FNanchor_638_638" href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> The Moquis allow their wives to work
only indoors, afraid of having rivals.<a id="FNanchor_639_639" href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> The Arawaks,<a id="FNanchor_640_640" href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> as also
the Indians of Peru,<a id="FNanchor_641_641" href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> are stated to commit horrible crimes of
jealousy. The Botocudos, who are known to change wives
very frequently, are, nevertheless, much addicted to that
passion.<a id="FNanchor_642_642" href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> And, regarding the Coroados of Brazil, v. Spix and
v. Martius say that revenge and jealousy are the only passions
that can rouse their stunted soul from its moody indifference.<a id="FNanchor_643_643" href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></p>

<p>In the Sandwich Islands, according to Lisiansky, jealousy
was extremely prevalent,<a id="FNanchor_644_644" href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> and, in Nukahiva, the men punish
their wives with severity upon the least suspicion of infidelity.<a id="FNanchor_645_645" href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">645</a>
The Areois of Tahiti, too, although given to
every kind of licentiousness, are described by Ellis as utterly
jealous.<a id="FNanchor_646_646" href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> The same is said of the New Caledonians and New
Zealanders;<a id="FNanchor_647_647" href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> whilst, in the Pelew Islands, it is forbidden even
to speak about another man’s wife or mention her name.<a id="FNanchor_648_648" href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">648</a>
In short, the South Sea Islanders are, as Mr. Macdonald
remarks, generally jealous of the chastity of their wives.<a id="FNanchor_649_649" href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Among the Malays of Sumatra, the husband jealously
guards his wife as long as his affection lasts;<a id="FNanchor_650_650" href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> and, concerning
several other tribes of the Indian Archipelago, Riedel says
that the men are very much addicted to the same passion.<a id="FNanchor_651_651" href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a>
Captain Arnesen observed the great jealousy of the Samoyedes.<a id="FNanchor_652_652" href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a>
Dr. A. O. Heikel informs me that a Tartar may
repudiate his wife if he sees her shaking hands with a man.
Among the nomadic Koriaks, many wives are killed by passionate
husbands. Hence their women endeavour to be very
ugly: they refrain from dressing their hair or washing, and
walk about ragged, as the husbands take for granted that, if
they dress themselves, they do so in order to attract admirers.<a id="FNanchor_653_653" href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></p>

<p>Among the Beni-Mzab, a man who speaks in the street to
a married woman of quality is punished with a fine of two
hundred francs and banishment for four years.<a id="FNanchor_654_654" href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> In the Nile
countries and many other parts of Africa, it is customary for
the men to preserve the fidelity of their wives in a way not
unlike a method used in the age of the Crusades.<a id="FNanchor_655_655" href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> With
reference to the inhabitants of Fida, Bosman tells us that a
rich negro will not suffer any man to enter the houses where
his wives reside, and on the least suspicion will sell them to
the Europeans;<a id="FNanchor_656_656" href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> whilst in Dahomey, if a wayfarer meets any
of the royal wives on the road, a bell warns him “to turn off
or stand against a wall while they pass.”<a id="FNanchor_657_657" href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></p>

<p>That jealousy is a powerful agent in the social life of civilized
nations is a fact which it is unnecessary to dwell upon.
In Mohammedan countries, a woman is not allowed to
receive male visitors, or to go out unveiled,<a id="FNanchor_658_658" href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> it being un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>lawful
for the Moslem to see the faces of any other women
than those whom he is forbidden to marry and his own
wives and female slaves.<a id="FNanchor_659_659" href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> A man who penetrates into the
harem of another man may easily lose his life; and Dr.
Polak states that, in Persia, a European physician cannot,
without being considered indecent, even ask about the health
of a Mohammedan’s wife and daughter, though they are ill.<a id="FNanchor_660_660" href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a>
Again, in Japan, as I am told by a native of the country, it
was customary for women when getting married, to have
their eyebrows shaved off, because thick and beautiful eyebrows
are considered one of a woman’s greatest ornaments.
At the same time, according to Mr. Balfour, their teeth are
stained black, which can only have the effect of making
the wife less attractive to the husband,—as well as to
other men.<a id="FNanchor_661_661" href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> This reminds us of the wide-spread practice
of depriving a woman of her ornaments as soon as she is
married.</p>

<p>The prevalence of jealousy in the human race is best shown
by the punishments inflicted for adultery; although it may
be that the proprietary feeling here plays an important
part. In a savage country a seducer may be thankful if he
escapes by paying to the injured husband the value of the
bride or some other fine, or if the penalty is reduced to a
flogging, to his head being shaved, his ears cut off, one of
his eyes destroyed, his legs speared, &amp;c., &amp;c. He must consider
himself very lucky if he is merely paid in his own coin,
or if the punishment falls on his wife, who, in that case, seems
to be looked upon as the real cause of her husband’s unfaithfulness.<a id="FNanchor_662_662" href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a>
Most commonly, among uncivilized nations, the
seducer is killed, adultery on the woman’s side being considered
a heinous crime, for which nothing but the death of
the offender can atone. Among the Waganda, it is, as a rule,
punished even more severely than murder;<a id="FNanchor_663_663" href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> and, in parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
New Guinea, capital punishment is said to be almost unknown
except for adultery.<a id="FNanchor_664_664" href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></p>

<p>Mr. Reade remarks that, among savages generally, it is the
seducer who suffers, not the victim.<a id="FNanchor_665_665" href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> Yet this holds good for
certain peoples only,<a id="FNanchor_666_666" href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> the faithless wife being generally discarded,
beaten, or ill-treated in some other way, and very
frequently killed. Often, too, she is disfigured by her jealous
husband, so that no man may fall in love with her in future.
Thus, among several peoples of North America, India, and
elsewhere, her nose is cut or bitten off,—a practice which also
prevailed in ancient Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_667_667" href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> As late as the year 1120 the
Council of Neapolis in Palestine decreed that an adulterer
should be castrated, and the nose of an unfaithful wife cut
off;<a id="FNanchor_668_668" href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> whilst, in the “Uplands-lag,” an old Swedish provincial
law, it is prescribed that an adulteress who cannot pay the
fine of forty marks, shall lose her hair, ears, and nose.<a id="FNanchor_669_669" href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> The
Creeks and some Chittagong Hill tribes likewise cut off the
ears of a woman who has been guilty of infidelity;<a id="FNanchor_670_670" href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> and many
other people are in the habit of shaving her head.<a id="FNanchor_671_671" href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>Among a large number of peoples, a husband not only
requires chastity from his wife, but demands that the woman
whom he marries shall be a virgin. There can be little
doubt, I think, that this requirement owes its origin to
the same powerful feeling that keeps watch over marital
faithfulness.</p>

<p>Among the Ahts, for example, “a girl who was known to
have lost her virtue, lost with it one of her chances of a
favourable marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_672_672" href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> Among the Chippewas, according to
Mr. Keating, no woman could expect to be taken as a wife
by a warrior unless she had lived in strict chastity.<a id="FNanchor_673_673" href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> Statements
to the same effect are made with reference to other
Indian tribes.<a id="FNanchor_674_674" href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> Again, when one of the Chichimecs of Central
Mexico marries, if the girl proves not to be a virgin, she may
be returned to her parents.<a id="FNanchor_675_675" href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> A very similar custom prevailed
among the Nicaraguans and Azteks,<a id="FNanchor_676_676" href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> and exist still among
several tribes of the Indian Archipelago and in New Guinea;<a id="FNanchor_677_677" href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a>
whilst, in Samoa, valuable presents were given for a girl who
had preserved her virtue, the bride’s purity being proved
in a way that will not bear the light of description.<a id="FNanchor_678_678" href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a></p>

<p>“In many parts of Africa,” says Mr. Reade, “no marriage
can be ratified till a jury of matrons have pronounced a
verdict of purity on the bride;<a id="FNanchor_679_679" href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> it being customary to return
a girl who is found not to have been entirely chaste, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
claim back the price paid for her.<a id="FNanchor_680_680" href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> Dr. Grade states that
among the Negroes of Togoland, a much higher price is paid
for a bride who is a virgin than for any other.<a id="FNanchor_681_681" href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> Among the
Somals, a fallen girl cannot become a man’s legitimate wife;<a id="FNanchor_682_682" href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a>
whilst, in the Soudan and other parts of Africa where girls
are subjected to infibulation, that incontinence may be made
impossible, no young woman who is not infibulated can get a
husband.<a id="FNanchor_683_683" href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></p>

<p>The Jewish custom of handing “the tokens of the damsel’s
virginity” to her parents, to be kept as evidence in case of a
later accusation, is well-known.<a id="FNanchor_684_684" href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> A practice not very dissimilar
to this prevails in China,<a id="FNanchor_685_685" href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> Arabia,<a id="FNanchor_686_686" href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> and among the
Chuvashes,<a id="FNanchor_687_687" href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> with whom the <i>signum innocentiae</i> is exhibited
even <i>coram populo</i>. In Persia,<a id="FNanchor_688_688" href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> as also in Circassia,<a id="FNanchor_689_689" href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> a
girl who is not a virgin when she marries, runs the risk of
being put away after the first night. Among several nations
belonging to the Russian Empire, according to Georgi, the
bridegroom may claim a fine in case of the bride being found
to have lost her virtue;<a id="FNanchor_690_690" href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> and, among the Chulims, if the
Mosaic testimony of chastity is wanting, the husband goes
away and does not return before the seducer has made peace
with him.<a id="FNanchor_691_691" href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> As to the ancient Germans, Tacitus states that,
by their laws, virgins only could marry.<a id="FNanchor_692_692" href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<p>A husband’s pretensions may reach even farther than this.
He often demands that the woman he chooses for his wife
shall belong to him, not during his lifetime only, but after his
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>The belief in another life is almost universal in the human
race. As that life is supposed to resemble this, man having
the same necessities there as here, part of his property is
buried with him. And so strong is the idea of a wife being
the exclusive property of her husband, that, among several
peoples, she may not even survive him.</p>

<p>Thus, formerly, among the Comanches, when a man died,
his favourite wife was killed at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_693_693" href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> In certain
Californian tribes, widows were sacrificed on the pyre with
their deceased husbands;<a id="FNanchor_694_694" href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> and Mackenzie was told that this
practice sometimes occurred among the Crees.<a id="FNanchor_695_695" href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> In Darien
and Panama, on the death of a chief, all his concubines were
interred with him.<a id="FNanchor_696_696" href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> When one of the Incas died, says Acosta,
the woman whom he had loved best, as well as his servants
and officers, were put to death, “that they might serve him
in the other life.”<a id="FNanchor_697_697" href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> The same custom prevailed in the region
of the Congo, as also in some other African countries.<a id="FNanchor_698_698" href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> “It
is no longer possible to doubt,” says Dr. Schrader, “that
ancient Indo-Germanic custom ordained that the wife should
die with her husband.”<a id="FNanchor_699_699" href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> In India, as is well known,
widows were sacrificed, until quite recently, on the funeral
pile of their husbands;<a id="FNanchor_700_700" href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> whilst, among the Tartars, according
to Navarette, on a man’s death, one of his wives hanged
herself “to bear him company in that journey.” Among
the Chinese, something of the same kind seems to have been
done occasionally in olden times.<a id="FNanchor_701_701" href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></p>

<p>Turning to other quarters of the world: in Polynesia, and
especially in Melanesia, widows were very commonly killed.<a id="FNanchor_702_702" href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a>
In Fiji, for instance, they were either buried alive or strangled,
often at their own desire, because they believed that in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
way alone could they reach the realms of bliss, and that she
who met her death with the greatest devotedness, would
become the favourite wife in the abode of spirits. On the
other hand, a widow who did not permit herself to be killed
was considered an adulteress.<a id="FNanchor_703_703" href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> In the New Hebrides, according
to the missionary John Inglis, a wife is strangled, even
when her husband is long absent from home.<a id="FNanchor_704_704" href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></p>

<p>If the husband’s demands are less severe, his widow is not
on that account always exempted from every duty towards
him after his death. Among the Tacullies, she is compelled
by the kinsfolk of the deceased to lie on the funeral pile where
the body of her husband is placed, whilst the fire is lighting,
until the heat becomes unbearable. Then, after the body
is consumed, she is obliged to collect the ashes and deposit
them in a small basket, which she must always carry about
with her for two or three years, during which time she is not
at liberty to marry again.<a id="FNanchor_705_705" href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> Among the Kutchin Indians, the
widow, or widows, are bound to remain near the body for a
year to protect it from animals, &amp;c.; and only when it is quite
decayed and merely the bones remain, are they permitted
to remarry, “to dress their hair, and put on beads and
other ornaments to attract admirers.”<a id="FNanchor_706_706" href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> Again, among the
Minas on the Slave Coast, the widows are shut up for six
months in the room where their husband is buried.<a id="FNanchor_707_707" href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> With
the Kukis, according to Rennel, a widow was compelled to
remain for a year beside the tomb of her deceased husband,
her family bringing her food.<a id="FNanchor_708_708" href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> In the Mosquito tribe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> “the
widow was bound to supply the grave of her husband with
provisions for a year, after which she took up the bones and
carried them with her for another year, at last placing them
upon the roof of her house, and then only was she allowed
to marry again.”<a id="FNanchor_709_709" href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a></p>

<p>In Rotuma and the Marquesas Islands,<a id="FNanchor_710_710" href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> as well as among
the Tartars and Iroquois,<a id="FNanchor_711_711" href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> a widow was never allowed to enter
a second time into the married state. Among the ancient
Peruvians, says Garcilasso de la Vega, very few widows
who had no children ever married again, and even widows
who had children continued to live single; “for this virtue
was much commended in their laws and ordinances.”<a id="FNanchor_712_712" href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> Nor is
it in China considered proper for a widow to contract a second
marriage, and in genteel families such an event rarely, if ever,
occurs. Indeed, a lady of rank, by contracting a second
marriage, exposes herself to a penalty of eighty blows.<a id="FNanchor_713_713" href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a>
Again, the Arabs, according to Burckhardt, regard everything
connected with the nuptials of a widow as ill-omened,
and unworthy of the participation of generous and honourable
men.<a id="FNanchor_714_714" href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Aryans, Dr. Schrader remarks that, when
sentiments had become more humane, traces of the old
state of things survived in the prohibitions issued against the
second marriage of widows.<a id="FNanchor_715_715" href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> Even now, according to
Dubois, the happiest lot that can befall a Hindu woman,
particularly one of the Brahman caste, is to die in the married
state. The bare mention of a second marriage for her would
be considered the greatest of insults, and, if she married again,
“she would be hunted out of society, and no decent person
would venture at any time to have the slightest intercourse
with her.”<a id="FNanchor_716_716" href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> Again, among the Bhills, when a widow marries,
the newly-wedded pair, according to a long-established custom,
are obliged to leave the house before daybreak and pass the
next day in the fields, in a solitary place, some miles from the
village, nor may they return till the dusk. The necessity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the couple passing the first day of their marriage in this way,
like outcasts, is, writes Sir J. Malcolm, “to mark that sense
of degradation which all the natives of Hindustan entertain
against a woman marrying a second husband.”<a id="FNanchor_717_717" href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> The South
Slavonians, says Krauss, regard a widow’s remarriage as an
insult to her former consort;<a id="FNanchor_718_718" href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> and a similar view prevailed in
ancient Greece, according to Pausanias,<a id="FNanchor_719_719" href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> and among the
Romans.<a id="FNanchor_720_720" href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> The early Christians, also, strongly disapproved
of second marriages by persons of either sex, although St.
Paul had peremptorily urged that the younger widows should
marry.<a id="FNanchor_721_721" href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> Indeed the practice of second nuptials was branded
with the name of a legal adultery, and the persons who were
guilty of so scandalous an offence against Christian purity
were soon excluded from the honours and even from the
alms of the Church.<a id="FNanchor_722_722" href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></p>

<p>Much more commonly, however, the prohibition of a
second marriage refers only to a certain period after the
husband’s death. Thus, among the Chickasaws, widows were
obliged to live a chaste single life for three years at the
risk of the law of adultery being executed against the recusants;<a id="FNanchor_723_723" href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a>
whilst, among the Creeks, a widow was looked upon
as an adulteress if she spoke or made free with any man
within four summers after the death of her husband.<a id="FNanchor_724_724" href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> Among
the Old Kukis, widowers and widows could not marry within
three years, and then only with the permission of the family
of the deceased.<a id="FNanchor_725_725" href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> Among the Kunáma, too, the period of
widowhood must not be shorter than three years, in Saraë not
less than two.<a id="FNanchor_726_726" href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> The Arawaks, British Columbians, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Mandans required that the head of the widow should be
shaved, and she was not permitted to marry again before her
shorn locks regained their wonted length.<a id="FNanchor_727_727" href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> Among the
Hovas, Ainos, Patagonians, &amp;c., the widow has to live a single
life for a year at least after her husband’s death,<a id="FNanchor_728_728" href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> and among
some other peoples for six months.<a id="FNanchor_729_729" href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></p>

<p>It may perhaps be supposed that the object of these prohibitions
is to remove all apprehensions as to pregnancy. But
this cannot be the case when the time of mourning lasts
for a year or more. In Saraë, where a widow is bound
to celibacy for two years, a divorced wife is prevented
from marrying within two months only, as Munzinger says,
“in order to avoid all uncertainty as to pregnancy;”<a id="FNanchor_730_730" href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">730</a>
and, among the Bedouins, a divorced woman has, for the
same reason, to remain unmarried for no longer time than
forty days.<a id="FNanchor_731_731" href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> Moreover, certain peoples, especially those
among whom monogamy is the only recognized form of
marriage, or among whom polygyny is practised as a rare
exception, prohibit the speedy remarriage not only of widows
but of widowers.<a id="FNanchor_732_732" href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">732</a></p>

<p>The meaning of the interdict appears also from the common
rule that a wife, after her husband’s death, shall give up all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
her ornaments, and have her head shaved, her hair cut short,
or her face blackened. Among certain Indians, the law compels
the widow through the long term of her mourning to
refrain from all public company and diversions, under pain of
being considered an adulteress, and, likewise to go with flowing hair
without the privilege of oil to anoint it;<a id="FNanchor_733_733" href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> whilst, in
Greenland tales, it is said of a truly disconsolate widow,
“She mourns so, that she cannot be recognised for dirt.”<a id="FNanchor_734_734" href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">734</a></p>

<p>Hence we see how deep-rooted is the idea that a woman
belongs exclusively to one man. Savages believe that the
soul of the deceased can return and become a tormentor of
the living. Thus a husband, even after his death, may
punish a wife who has proved unfaithful.</p>

<p>According to travellers’ statements, there are, indeed,
peoples almost devoid of the feeling of jealousy, and the
practice of lending or prostituting wives is generally taken as
evidence of this. But jealousy, as well as love, is far from
being the same feeling in the mind of a savage as in that of
a civilized man. A wife is often regarded as not very different
from other property, and an adulterer as a thief.<a id="FNanchor_735_735" href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> In some
parts of Africa, he is punished as such, having his hands,
or one of them, cut off.<a id="FNanchor_736_736" href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> The fact that a man lends his wife
to a visitor no more implies the absence of jealousy than
other ways of showing hospitality imply that he is without
the proprietary feeling. According to Wilkes, the aborigines
of New South Wales “will frequently give one of their wives
to a friend who may be in want of one; but notwithstanding
this laxity they are extremely jealous, and are very prompt to
resent any freedom taken with their wives.”<a id="FNanchor_737_737" href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">737</a></p>

<p>A married woman is never permitted to cohabit with any
man but the husband, except with the husband’s permission;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and this permission is given only as an act of hospitality or
friendship, or as a means of profit. When we are told that a
negro husband uses his wife for entrapping other men and
making them pay a heavy fine;<a id="FNanchor_738_738" href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> that, among the Crees,
adultery is considered no crime “provided the husband receives
a valuable consideration for his wife’s prostitution;”<a id="FNanchor_739_739" href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">739</a>
or that, in Nukahiva, husbands sometimes offer their wives to
foreigners “from their ardent desire of possessing iron, or other
European articles,”<a id="FNanchor_740_740" href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">740</a>—we must not infer from this profligacy
that jealousy is unknown to man at early stages of civilization.
On the contrary, such practices are due chiefly to
contact with “higher culture,” which often has the effect of
misleading natural instincts. “Husbands, after the degradation
of a pseudo-civilization,” says Mr. Bonwick, “are sometimes
found ready to barter the virtue of a wife for a piece of
tobacco, a morsel of bread, or a silver sixpence.”<a id="FNanchor_741_741" href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> Mr. Curr
observes that, among the Australian natives, “husbands display
much less jealousy of white men than of those of their
own colour,” and that they will more commonly prostitute
their wives to strangers visiting the tribe than to their own
people.<a id="FNanchor_742_742" href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> “Under no circumstances,” says Sir George Grey,
“is a strange native allowed to approach the fire of a
married man.”<a id="FNanchor_743_743" href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> According to Bosman, the Negroes of
Benin were very jealous of their wives with their own countrymen,
though not in the least with European foreigners;<a id="FNanchor_744_744" href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> and
Lisiansky states exactly the same as regards the Sandwich
Islanders.<a id="FNanchor_745_745" href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> In California, says Mr. Powers, “since the advent
of the Americans the husband often traffics in his wife’s
honour for gain, and even forces her to infamy when unwilling;
though in early days he would have slain her without
pity and without remorse for the same offence.”<a id="FNanchor_746_746" href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> The like is
true of the Columbians about Puget Sound;<a id="FNanchor_747_747" href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> and Georgi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
remarks that the nomadic Koriaks torment their wives by
their jealousy, sometimes even killing them from this passion;
whereas those Koriaks who lead a stationary life, being far
more advanced in civilization, are so little addicted to it, that
they even have a relish for seeing foreigners make love to
their wives, whom they dress accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_748_748" href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">748</a></p>

<p>If the hypothesis of an annual pairing time in the infancy
of mankind holds good, jealousy must at that stage have
been a passion of very great intensity.</p>

<p>It may, however, be supposed that this feeling, though belonging
to human nature, has been restrained by certain conditions
which have made it necessary, or desirable, for a man
to share his wife with other men. Thus polyandry now
prevails in several parts of the world. But I shall endeavour
to show, later on, that this practice is due chiefly to scarcity
of women, and commonly implies an act of fraternal benevolence,
the eldest and first married brother in a family giving
his younger brothers a share in his wife, if they would
otherwise be obliged to live unmarried. Hence polyandry
can by no means, as Mr. McLennan suggests, be regarded as
“a modification of and advance from promiscuity.” It owes
its origin to causes, or a cause, which never would have produced
general communism in women. Besides, it can be
proved that polyandry is abhorrent to the rudest races of
men.</p>

<p>It has been suggested, too, that man’s gregarious way of
living made promiscuity necessary. The men of a group, it
is said, must either have quarrelled about their women and
separated, splitting the horde into hostile sections, or indulged
in promiscuous intercourse. But it is hard to understand why
tribal organization in olden times should have prevented a
man having his special wife, since it does not do so among
savages still existing. Primitive law is the law of might; and
it is impossible to believe that the stronger men, who generally
succeeded in getting the most comely women, voluntarily
gave their weaker rivals a share in their precious capture.
Regarding the aborigines of Queensland, Lumholtz states
that as a rule, it is difficult for men to marry before they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
thirty years of age, the old men having the youngest and
best-looking wives, while a young man must consider himself
fortunate if he can get an old woman.<a id="FNanchor_749_749" href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> It more commonly
happens among savages, however, that almost every full-grown
man is able to get a wife for himself; and when this is
the case, there is still less reason for assuming communism
in women.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, impossible that, among some peoples,
intercourse between the sexes may have been almost promiscuous.
But there is not a shred of genuine evidence for the
notion that promiscuity ever formed a general stage in the
social history of mankind. The hypothesis of promiscuity,
instead of belonging, as Professor Giraud-Teulon thinks,<a id="FNanchor_750_750" href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> to
the class of hypotheses which are scientifically permissible,
has no real foundation, and is essentially unscientific.</p>

<small>MARRIAGE AND CELIBACY</small></h2>


<p>With wild animals sexual desire is not less powerful as an
incentive to strenuous exertion than hunger and thirst. In the
rut-time, the males even of the most cowardly species engage
in mortal combats; and abstinence, or at least voluntary
abstinence, is almost unheard of in a state of nature.<a id="FNanchor_751_751" href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></p>

<p>As regards savage and barbarous races of men, among whom
the relations of the sexes under normal conditions take the
form of marriage, nearly every individual strives to get
married as soon as he, or she, reaches the age of puberty.<a id="FNanchor_752_752" href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a>
Hence there are far fewer bachelors and spinsters among them
than among civilized peoples. Harmon found that among
the Blackfeet, Crees, Chippewyans, and other aboriginal tribes
on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, celibacy was a
rare exception;<a id="FNanchor_753_753" href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> and Ashe noted the same fact among the
Shawanese.<a id="FNanchor_754_754" href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> Prescott states of the Dacotahs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> “I do not
know of a bachelor among them. They have a little more
respect for the women and themselves, than to live a single
life.”<a id="FNanchor_755_755" href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> Indeed, according to Adair, many Indian women
thought virginity and widowhood the same as death.<a id="FNanchor_756_756" href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> Among
the Eastern Greenlanders, visited by Lieutenant Holm, only
one unmarried woman was met with.<a id="FNanchor_757_757" href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">757</a></p>

<p>The Charruas, says Azara, “ne restent jamais dans le
célibat, et ils se marient aussitôt qu’ils sentent le besoin de
cette union.”<a id="FNanchor_758_758" href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> As regards the Yahgans, Mr. Bridges writes
that “none but mutes and imbeciles remained single, except some
lads of vigour who did so from choice, influenced by licentiousness.
But no woman remained unmarried; almost immediately
on her husband’s death the widow found another
husband.”</p>

<p>Among the wild nations of Southern Africa, according to
Burchell, neither men nor women ever pass their lives in
a state of celibacy;<a id="FNanchor_759_759" href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> and Bosman assures us that very few
negroes of the Gold Coast died single, unless they were quite
young.<a id="FNanchor_760_760" href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> Among the Mandingoes, Caillié met with no
instance of a young woman, pretty or plain, who had not a
husband.<a id="FNanchor_761_761" href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> Barth reports that the Western Touaregs had no
fault to find with him except that he lived in celibacy; they
could not even understand how this was possible.<a id="FNanchor_762_762" href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a></p>

<p>Among the Sinhalese there are hardly any old bachelors
and old maids;<a id="FNanchor_763_763" href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> and Mr. Marshall says of the Todas, “No
unmarried class exists, to disturb society with its loves and
broils; ... it is a ‘very much married’ people. Every
man and every woman, every lad and every girl is somebody’s
husband or wife; tied at the earliest possible age....
With the exception of a cripple girl, and of those women who,
past the child-bearing age, were widows, I did not meet with
a single instance of unmarried adult females.”<a id="FNanchor_764_764" href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> Among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Toungtha, it is unheard of for a man or woman to be unmarried
after the age of thirty, and among the Chukmas, a
bachelor twenty-five years old is rarely seen.<a id="FNanchor_765_765" href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> The Muásís
consider it a father’s duty to fix upon a bridegroom as soon as
his daughter becomes marriageable.<a id="FNanchor_766_766" href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> Among the Burmese<a id="FNanchor_767_767" href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a>
and the Hill Dyaks of Borneo,<a id="FNanchor_768_768" href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> old maids and old bachelors
are alike unknown. Among the Sumatrans, too, instances of
persons of either sex passing their lives in a state of celibacy
are extremely rare:—“In the districts under my charge,” says
Marsden, “are about eight thousand inhabitants, among
whom I do not conceive it would be possible to find ten
instances of men of the age of thirty years unmarried.”<a id="FNanchor_769_769" href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> In
Java, Mr. Crawfurd “never saw a woman of two-and-twenty
that was not, or had not been, married.”<a id="FNanchor_770_770" href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> In Tonga,
according to Mariner, there were but few women who, from
whim or some accidental cause, remained single for life.<a id="FNanchor_771_771" href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> In
Australia, “nearly all the girls are betrothed at a very early
age;” and Mr. Curr never heard of a woman, over sixteen years
of age, who, prior to the breakdown of aboriginal customs after
the coming of the Whites, had not a husband.<a id="FNanchor_772_772" href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> As to the
natives of Herbert River, Northern Queensland, Herr
Lumholtz says that though the majority of the young men
have to wait a long time before they get wives, it is rare for a
man to die unmarried.<a id="FNanchor_773_773" href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">773</a></p>

<p>Indeed, so indispensable does marriage seem to uncivilized
man, that a person who does not marry is looked upon
almost as an unnatural being, or, at any rate, is disdained.<a id="FNanchor_774_774" href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">774</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Among the Santals, if a man remains single, “he is at once
despised by both sexes, and is classed next to a thief, or
a witch: they term the unhappy wretch ‘No man.’”<a id="FNanchor_775_775" href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">775</a>
Among the Kafirs, a bachelor has no voice in the kraal.<a id="FNanchor_776_776" href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">776</a>
The Tipperahs, as we are told by Mr. J. F. Browne, do not
consider a man a person of any importance till he is married;<a id="FNanchor_777_777" href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">777</a>
and, in the Tupi tribes, no man was suffered to partake
of the drinking-feast while he remained single.<a id="FNanchor_778_778" href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> The Fijians
even believed that he who died wifeless was stopped by the god
Nangganangga on the road to Paradise, and smashed to atoms.<a id="FNanchor_779_779" href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a></p>

<p>It may also be said that savages, as a rule, marry earlier in
life than civilized men. A Greenlander, says Dr. Nansen,
often marries before there is any chance of the union being
productive.<a id="FNanchor_780_780" href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> Among the Californians, Mandans, and most
of the north-western tribes in North America, marriage frequently
takes place at the age of twelve or fourteen.<a id="FNanchor_781_781" href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> In the
wild tribes of Central Mexico, girls are seldom unmarried
after the age of fourteen or fifteen.<a id="FNanchor_782_782" href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> Among the Talamanca
Indians, a bride is generally from ten to fourteen years old,
whilst a man seldom becomes a husband before fourteen.<a id="FNanchor_783_783" href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> In
certain other Central American tribes, the parents try to get
a wife for their son when he is nine or ten years old.<a id="FNanchor_784_784" href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">784</a></p>

<p>Among the natives of Brazil, the man generally marries at
the age of from fifteen to eighteen, the woman from ten to
twelve.<a id="FNanchor_785_785" href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> According to Azara, the like was the case with the
Guaranies of the Plata, whilst, among the Guanas, “celle qui
se marie le plus tard, se marie à neuf ans.”<a id="FNanchor_786_786" href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> In Tierra del<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Fuego, as we are informed by Lieutenant Bove, a girl looks
about for a husband when twelve or thirteen years old, and a
youth marries at the age of from fourteen to sixteen.<a id="FNanchor_787_787" href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></p>

<p>Many African peoples, <i>e.g.</i>, the Abyssinians,<a id="FNanchor_788_788" href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> the Beni-Amer,
the Djour tribes on the White Nile,<a id="FNanchor_789_789" href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> the Arabs of the
Sahara, the Wakamba, and the Ba-kwileh,<a id="FNanchor_790_790" href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> are likewise said
to marry very young. Marriage usually takes place, among
the Bongos when they are from fifteen to seventeen years old,
but in many other tribes at an earlier age.<a id="FNanchor_791_791" href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a></p>

<p>Among the Sinhalese, when a young man has reached the
age of eighteen or twenty, it is the duty of his father to provide
him with a proper wife.<a id="FNanchor_792_792" href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> Among the Bodo and Dhimáls,
“marriage takes place at maturity, the male being usually
from twenty to twenty-five years of age, and the female from
fifteen to twenty.”<a id="FNanchor_793_793" href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> A Santal lad marries, as a rule, about
the age of sixteen or seventeen, and a girl at that of fifteen;<a id="FNanchor_794_794" href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">794</a>
whilst a Kandh boy marries when he reaches his tenth or
twelfth year, his wife being usually about four years older.<a id="FNanchor_795_795" href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">795</a>
The Khyoungtha,<a id="FNanchor_796_796" href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> Munda Kols,<a id="FNanchor_797_797" href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> Red Karens,<a id="FNanchor_798_798" href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> Siamese,<a id="FNanchor_799_799" href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">799</a>

to marry early. Among the Ainos, the young women are
considered marriageable at the age of sixteen or seventeen,
and the men marry when about nineteen or twenty.<a id="FNanchor_802_802" href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Again, among the Lake Dwellers of Lob-nor, girls enter into
matrimony at the age of fourteen or fifteen, men at the same
age, or a little later;<a id="FNanchor_803_803" href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> whilst, among the Malays, according to
Mr. Bickmore, the boys usually marry for the first time when
about sixteen, and the girls at the age of thirteen or fourteen,
and occasionally still earlier.<a id="FNanchor_804_804" href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a></p>

<p>Passing to the Australian continent: among the natives of
New South Wales, the parties are in most cases betrothed
very early in life, the young man claiming his wife later on, as
soon as he arrives at the proper age.<a id="FNanchor_805_805" href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> According to Mr.
Curr, “girls become wives at from eight to fourteen years of
age.”<a id="FNanchor_806_806" href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> At Port Moresby, New Guinea, “few men over
twenty years of age remain single;” and the Maoris in New
Zealand are stated to marry very young.<a id="FNanchor_807_807" href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a></p>

<p>Moreover, celibacy is comparatively rare not only among
savage and barbarous, but among several civilized races.</p>

<p>Among the Azteks, no young man lived single till his
twenty-second year, unless he intended to become a priest,
and for girls the customary marrying-age was from eleven to
eighteen. In Tlascala, according to Clavigero, the unmarried
state was, indeed, so despised that a full-grown man who
would not marry had his hair cut off for shame.<a id="FNanchor_808_808" href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> Again,
among the ancient Peruvians, every year, or every two years,
each governor in his district had to arrange for the marriage
of all the young men at the age of twenty-four and upwards,
and all the girls from eighteen to twenty.<a id="FNanchor_809_809" href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a></p>

<p>In Japan, as I am told by a Japanese friend, old maids and
old bachelors are almost entirely unknown, and the same is
the case in China.<a id="FNanchor_810_810" href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> “Almost all Chinese,” says Dr. Gray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
“robust or infirm, well-formed or deformed, are called upon
by their parents to marry so soon as they have attained the
age of puberty. Were a grown-up son or daughter to die
unmarried, the parents would regard it as most deplorable.”
Hence a young man of marriageable age, whom consumption
or any other lingering disease had marked for its own, would
be called upon by his parents or guardians to marry at once.<a id="FNanchor_811_811" href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a>
Nay, so indispensable is marriage considered among this
people, that even the dead are married. Thus the spirits of
all males who die in infancy, or in boyhood, are in due time
married to the spirits of females who have been cut off at a
like early age.<a id="FNanchor_812_812" href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a></p>

<p>Marco Polo states the prevalence of the same practice
among the Tartars.<a id="FNanchor_813_813" href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> In Corea, says the Rev. John Ross,
“the male human being who is unmarried is never called
a ‘man,’ whatever his age, but goes by the name of ‘yatow;’
a name given by the Chinese to unmarriageable young
girls: and the ‘man’ of thirteen or fourteen has a perfect
right to strike, abuse, order about the ‘yatow’ of thirty, who
dares not as much as open his lips to complain.”<a id="FNanchor_814_814" href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a></p>

<p>Mohammedan peoples generally consider marriage a duty
both for men and women.<a id="FNanchor_815_815" href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> “Nothing,” says Carsten Niebuhr,
“is more rarely to be met with in the East, than a woman
unmarried after a certain time of life.” She will rather
marry a poor man, or become second wife to a man already
married, than remain in a state of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_816_816" href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> Among the
Persians, for instance, almost every girl of good repute is
married before her twenty-first year, and old bachelors are
unknown.<a id="FNanchor_817_817" href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> In Egypt, according to Mr. Lane, it is improper
and even disreputable to abstain from marrying when a man
has attained a sufficient age, and when there is no just
impediment.<a id="FNanchor_818_818" href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>Among the Hebrews, celibacy was nearly unheard of, as it
is among the Jews of our day. They have a proverb that
“he who has no wife is no man.”<a id="FNanchor_819_819" href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> “To an ancient Israelite,”
Michaelis remarks, “it would indeed have appeared very
strange to have seen, though but in a vision, a period in the
future history of the world, when it would be counted sanctity
and religion to live unmarried.”<a id="FNanchor_820_820" href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> Marriage was by the
Hebrews looked upon as a religious duty. According to the
Talmud, the authorities can compel a man to marry, and he
who lives single at the age of twenty is accursed by God
almost as if he were a murderer.<a id="FNanchor_821_821" href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a></p>

<p>The ancient nations of the Aryan stock, as M. Fustel de
Coulanges and others have pointed out, regarded celibacy as
an impiety and a misfortune: “an impiety, because one who
did not marry put the happiness of the Manes of the family
in peril; a misfortune, because he himself would receive no
worship after his death.” A man’s happiness in the next
world depended upon his having a continuous line of male
descendants, whose duty it would be to make the periodical
offerings for the repose of his soul.<a id="FNanchor_822_822" href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></p>

<p>Thus, according to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ marriage is the
twelfth Sanskāra, and hence a religious duty incumbent upon
all.<a id="FNanchor_823_823" href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> “Until he finds a wife, a man is only half of a whole,” we
read in the ‘Brahmadharma’;<a id="FNanchor_824_824" href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> and, among the Hindus of the
present day, a man who is not married is considered to be
almost a useless member of society, and is, indeed, looked upon
as beyond the pale of nature. It is also an established
national rule, that women are designed for no other end than
to be subservient to the wants and pleasures of men; consequently,
all women without exception are obliged to marry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
when husbands can be found for them, and those who cannot
find a husband commonly fall into the state of concubinage.<a id="FNanchor_825_825" href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">825</a>
Among the ancient Iranians, too, it was considered a matter
of course that a girl should be married on reaching the years
of puberty.<a id="FNanchor_826_826" href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a></p>

<p>The ancient Greeks regarded marriage as a matter not
merely of private, but also of public interest. This was
particularly the case at Sparta, where criminal proceedings
might be taken against those who married too late, and
against those who did not marry at all. In Solon’s legislation
marriage was also placed under the inspection of the State,
and, at Athens, persons who did not marry might be prosecuted,
although the law seems to have grown obsolete in later times.
But independently of public considerations, there were private
reasons which made marriage an obligation.<a id="FNanchor_827_827" href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> Plato remarks
that every individual is bound to provide for a continuance of
representatives to succeed himself as ministers of the Divinity;<a id="FNanchor_828_828" href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a>
and Isaeus says, “All they who think their end approaching,
look forward with a prudent care that their houses may not
become desolate, but that there may be some person to attend
to their funeral rites, and to perform the legal ceremonies at
their tombs.”<a id="FNanchor_829_829" href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a></p>

<p>To the Roman citizen, as Mommsen observes, a house of
his own and the blessing of children appeared the end and
essence of life;<a id="FNanchor_830_830" href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> and Cicero’s treatise ‘De Legibus’—a treatise
which generally reproduces, in a philosophic form, the ancient
laws of Rome—contains a law, according to which the
Censors had to impose a tax upon unmarried men.<a id="FNanchor_831_831" href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> But in
later periods, when sexual morality reached a very low ebb in
Rome, celibacy—as to which grave complaints were made as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
early as 520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>—naturally increased in proportion, especially
among the well-off classes. Among these, marriage came to
be regarded as a burden which people took upon themselves
at the best in the public interest. Indeed, how it fared with
marriage and the rearing of children, is shown by the Gracchan
agrarian laws, which first placed a premium thereon;<a id="FNanchor_832_832" href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> whilst,
later on, the <i>Lex Julia et Papia Poppæa</i> imposed various
penalties on those who lived in a state of celibacy after a
certain age,<a id="FNanchor_833_833" href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a>—but with little or no result.<a id="FNanchor_834_834" href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></p>

<p>Again, the Germans, as described by Cæsar, accounted it in
the highest degree scandalous to have intercourse with the
other sex before the twentieth year.<a id="FNanchor_835_835" href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> Tacitus also asserts
that the young men married late, and the maidens did not
hurry into marriage.<a id="FNanchor_836_836" href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> But it seems probable that at a later
age celibacy was almost unknown among the Germans, except
in the case of women who had once lost their reputation, for
whom neither beauty, youth, nor riches could procure a
husband.<a id="FNanchor_837_837" href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> As for the Slavs, it should be observed that,
among the Russian peasantry celibacy is even now unheard of.<a id="FNanchor_838_838" href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>
When a youth reaches the age of eighteen, he is informed by
his parents that he ought to marry at once.<a id="FNanchor_839_839" href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a></p>

<p>There are, however, even in savage life, circumstances which
compel certain persons to live unmarried for a longer or
shorter time. When a wife has to be bought, a man must of
course have some fortune before he is able to marry. Thus, as
regards the Zulus, Mr. Eyles writes to me that “young men
who are without cattle have often to wait many years before
getting married.”<a id="FNanchor_840_840" href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> When Major-General Campbell asked
some of the Kandhs why they remained single, they replied
that they did so because wives were too expensive.<a id="FNanchor_841_841" href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> Among
the Munda Kols and Hos, in consequence of the high prices
of brides, are to be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> “what are probably not known
to exist in other parts of India, respectable elderly maidens.”<a id="FNanchor_842_842" href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">842</a>
In the New Britain Group, too, according to Mr. Romilly, the
purchase sum is never fixed at too low a price, hence “it constantly
happens that the intended husband is middle-aged
before he can marry.”<a id="FNanchor_843_843" href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> Similar statements are made in a
good many books of travels.<a id="FNanchor_844_844" href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a></p>

<p>Polygyny, in connection with slavery and the unequal
distribution of property, acts in the same direction. In
Makin, one of the Kingsmill Islands, a great number of
young men were unmarried owing to the majority of the
women being monopolized by the wealthy and powerful.<a id="FNanchor_845_845" href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a>
Among the Bakongo, according to Mr. Ingham, as also among
the Australians,<a id="FNanchor_846_846" href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> polygyny causes celibacy among the poorer
and younger men; and Dr. Sims says the like of the Bateke,
Mr. Cousins of the Kafirs, Mr. Radfield of the inhabitants of
Lifu. Among the Kutchin Indians, according to Hardisty,
there are but few young men who have wives—unless they
can content themselves with some old cast-off widow—on
account of all the chiefs, medicine men, and those who
possess rank acquired by property having two, three, or more
wives.<a id="FNanchor_847_847" href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> For the same reason many men of the lower classes
of the Waganda are obliged to remain single, in spite of the
large surplus of women.<a id="FNanchor_848_848" href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> In Micronesia, also, it is common
for the poorer class and the slaves to be doomed to perpetual
celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_849_849" href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> Among the Thlinkets, a slave cannot acquire pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>perty,
nor marry, except by consent of his master, which is
rarely given;<a id="FNanchor_850_850" href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> and in the Soudan the case seems to be the
same.<a id="FNanchor_851_851" href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a></p>

<p>But we must not exaggerate the importance of these
obstacles to marriage. When the man is not able to buy
a wife for himself, he may, in many cases, acquire her by
working for some time with her parents, or by eloping with
her. Moreover, as Sir John Lubbock remarks, the price of a
wife is generally regulated by the circumstances of the tribe,
so that nearly every industrious young man is enabled to get
one.<a id="FNanchor_852_852" href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> Speaking of the Sumatrans, Marsden observes that the
necessity of purchasing does not prove such an obstacle to
matrimony as is supposed, for there are few families who are not
in possession of some small substance, and the purchase-money
of the daughters serves also to provide wives for the sons.<a id="FNanchor_853_853" href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a>
Again, polygyny is, as we shall see further on, almost everywhere
restricted to a small minority of the people, and is very
often connected with the fact that there is a surplus of women.
Thus, among the polygynous Waguha, as I am informed by
Mr. Swann, unmarried grown-up men do not exist, the
women being more numerous than the men. At any rate,
we may conclude that at earlier stages of civilization, when
polygyny was practised less extensively and women were less
precious chattels than they afterwards became, celibacy was
a much rarer exception than it is now among many of the
lower races.</p>

<p>Passing to the peoples of Europe, we find, from the evidence
adduced by statisticians, that modern civilization has proved
very unfavourable to the number of marriages. In civilized
Europe, in 1875, more than a third of the male and female
population beyond the age of fifteen lived in a state of
voluntary or involuntary celibacy. Excluding Russia, the
number of celibates varied from 25·57 per cent. in Hungary
to 44·93 per cent. in Belgium. And among them there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
many who never marry.<a id="FNanchor_854_854" href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> In the middle of this century,
Wappäus found that, in Saxony, 14·6 per cent. of the unmarried
adult population died single; in Sweden, 14·9 per cent.;
in the Netherlands, 17·2 per cent.; and in France, 20·6 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_855_855" href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a>
Of the rest, many marry comparatively late in life. Thus, in
Denmark, only 19·43 per cent. of the married men were
under twenty-five, and in Bavaria (in 1870-1878), only 16.36,
whilst the figures for England and Russia look more favourable,
being respectively 51·90 per cent. (in 1872-1878), and
68·31 per cent. (in 1867-1875). Of the married women, on
the other hand, only 5·09 per cent. are below the age of twenty
in Sweden, 5·40 per cent. in Bavaria, 7·44 per cent. in Saxony,
14·86 per cent. in England, &amp;c.; but in Hungary as many as
35·16 per cent., and in Russia even 57·27 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_856_856" href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> The mean
age of the bachelors who enter into matrimony is 26 years in
England and 28·48 in France, that of the spinsters respectively
24·07 and 25·3.<a id="FNanchor_857_857" href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a></p>

<p>As a rule, the proportion of unmarried people has been
gradually increasing in Europe during this century,<a id="FNanchor_858_858" href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> and the
age at which people marry has risen. In England we need
not go further back than two decades, to find a greater tendency
on the part of men to defer marriage to later age
than was formerly the case.<a id="FNanchor_859_859" href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> Finally, it must be noted that
in country districts single men and women are more
seldom met with, and marriage is generally concluded
earlier in life, than in towns.<a id="FNanchor_860_860" href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></p>

<p>There are, indeed, several factors in modern civilization
which account for the comparatively large number of celibates.
In countries where polygyny is permitted, women
have a better chance of getting married than men, but in
Europe the case is reversed. Here, as in most parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
world, the adult women outnumber the adult men. If we
reckon the age for marriage from twenty to fifty years, a
hundred men may, in Europe, choose amongst a hundred and
three or four women, so that about three or four women per
cent. are doomed to a single life on account of our obligatory
monogamy.<a id="FNanchor_861_861" href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a></p>

<p>The chief cause, however, of increasing celibacy is the difficulty
of supporting a family in modern society. The importance
of this factor is distinctly proved by statistics. It has
been observed that the frequency of marriages is a very
sensible barometer of the hopes which the mass of people
have for the future; hard times, wars, commercial crises, &amp;c.,
regularly depressing the number of marriages, whilst comparative
abundance has the opposite effect.<a id="FNanchor_862_862" href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></p>

<p>In non-European countries into which a precocious civilization
has not been introduced, the population is more
nearly in proportion to the means of subsistence, and people
adapt their mode of life more readily to their circumstances.
In most cases a man can earn his living sooner;<a id="FNanchor_863_863" href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> and a wife
far from being a burden to her husband, is rather a help to
him, being his labourer or sometimes even his supporter.
Moreover, children, instead of requiring an education that
would absorb the father’s earnings, become, on the contrary,
a source of income. Thus Mr. Bickmore asserts that, among
the Malays, difficulty in supporting a family is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_864_864" href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a>
Carsten Niebuhr states that, in the East, men are as disposed
to marry as women, “because their wives, instead of
being expensive, are rather profitable to them.”<a id="FNanchor_865_865" href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> And, speaking
of the American Indians, Heriot says that children form
the wealth of savage tribes.<a id="FNanchor_866_866" href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>To a certain extent, the like is true of the agricultural
classes of Europe. A peasant’s wife helps her husband in the
field, tends the cattle, and takes part in the fishing. She cooks
and washes, sews, spins, and weaves. In a word, she does many
useful things about which women of the well-off classes never
think of troubling themselves. Hence in Russia, as we are
informed by M. Pietro Semenow, the small agriculturists,
who form an enormous proportion of the population, are in
the habit of arranging for the marriage of their sons at as
early an age as possible in order to secure an additional
female labourer.<a id="FNanchor_867_867" href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a></p>

<p>Even in cities it is not among the poorest classes that celibacy
is most frequent. A “gentleman,” before marrying,
thinks it necessary to have an income of which a mere fraction
would suffice for a married workman. He has to offer
his wife a home in accordance with her social position and his
own; and unless she brings him some fortune, she contributes
but little to the support of the family. Professor Vallis has
made out that, in the nobility and higher <i>bourgeoisie</i> of
Sweden, only 32 per cent. of the male population and 26 per
cent. of the female population are married, whilst the averages
for the whole population amount to 34 and 32 per cent.
respectively.<a id="FNanchor_868_868" href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> Some such disproportion must always exist
when the habits of life are luxurious, and the amount of income
does not correspond to them. And it is obvious that
women have to suffer from this trouble more than men, the
life of many of them being comparatively so useless, and their
pretensions, nevertheless, so high.</p>

<p>Another reason why the age for marriage has been raised
by advancing civilization is, that a man requires more time to
gain his living by intellectual than by material work. Thus,
miners, tailors, shoemakers, artisans, &amp;c., who earn in youth
almost as much as in later life, marry, as a rule, earlier than men
of the professional class.<a id="FNanchor_869_869" href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> In most European countries the
decrease in the number of married people is also partly due to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
the drafting of young men into the army, and their retention
in it in enforced bachelorhood during the years when nature
most strongly urges to matrimony.</p>

<p>Of course these conditions affect directly the marriage age
only of men, but indirectly they influence that of women
also. Many fall in love with their future wives long before
they are able to form a home, and those who marry late
generally avoid very great disparity of age.<a id="FNanchor_870_870" href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a></p>

<p>In one respect the average age at which women marry may
be said to depend directly upon the degree of civilization.
Dr. Ploss has justly pointed out that the ruder a people is,
and the more exclusively a woman is valued as an object of
desire, or as a slave, the earlier in life is she generally chosen;<a id="FNanchor_871_871" href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a>
whereas, if marriage becomes a union of souls as well as of
bodies, the man claims a higher degree of mental maturity
from the woman he wishes to be his wife.</p>

<p>At the lower stages of human development, the pleasures
of life consist chiefly in the satisfaction of natural wants and
instincts. Hence savages and barbarians scarcely ever dream
of voluntarily denying themselves “domestic bliss.” But, as
a writer in ‘The Nation’ says, “by the general diffusion of
education and culture, by the new inventions and discoveries
of the age, by the increase of commerce and intercourse
and wealth, the tastes of men and women have become
widened, their desires multiplied, new gratifications and
pleasures have been supplied to them. By this increase of
the gratifications of existence the relative share of them which
married life affords has become just so much less. The
domestic circle does not fill so large a place in life as formerly.
It is really less important to either man or woman. Married
life has lost in some measure its advantage over a single life.
There are so many more pleasures, now, that can be enjoyed as
well or even better in celibacy.”<a id="FNanchor_872_872" href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">872</a></p>

<p>It has further been suggested that the development of the
mental faculties has made the sexual impulse less powerful.
That instinct is said to be most excessive in animals which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
least excel in intelligence, the beasts which are the most
lascivious, as the ass, the boar, &amp;c., being also the most
stupid;<a id="FNanchor_873_873" href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> and M. Forel even believes that, among the ants,
increase of mind-power may have led to the sterility of the
workers.<a id="FNanchor_874_874" href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> Idiots, too, are known to display very gross sensuality.<a id="FNanchor_875_875" href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a>
Yet the suggestion that decrease of sexual desire is
a necessary attendant upon mental evolution cannot, so far as
I know, by any means be considered scientifically proved,
though we may safely say that if, among primitive men,
pairing was restricted to one season of the year, the sexual
instinct became gradually less intense as it became less
periodical. A higher degree of forethought and self-control
has, moreover, to a certain extent put the drag on human
passions.</p>

<p>Finally, there can be no doubt that the higher development
of feeling has helped to increase the number of those who
remain single. “By the diffusion of a finer culture throughout
the community,” says the above-mentioned writer in ‘The
Nation,’ “men and women can less easily find any one whom
they are willing to take as a partner for life; their requirements
are more exacting; their standards of excellence
higher; they are less able to find any who can satisfy their
own ideal, and less able to satisfy anybody else’s ideal. Men
and women have, too, a livelier sense of the serious and sacred
character of the marriage union, and of the high motives from
which alone it should be formed. They are less willing to
contract it from any lower motives.”<a id="FNanchor_876_876" href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a></p>

<p>In what direction is the civilized world tending with regard
to these matters? Will the number of celibates increase as
hitherto, or will there be some backward movement in that
respect? A definite answer cannot yet be given, since much
will depend on economical conditions which it is impossible
at present to foresee.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before this chapter is closed, it may be worth while to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
glance at the curious notion that there is something impure
and sinful in marriage, as in sexual relations generally. The
missionary Jellinghaus found this idea prevalent among the
Munda Kols in Chota Nagpore. Once when he asked them,
“May a dog sin?” the answer was, “If the dog did not sin
how could he breed?”<a id="FNanchor_877_877" href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> In Efate, of the New Hebrides,
according to Mr. Macdonald, sexual intercourse is regarded
as something unclean;<a id="FNanchor_878_878" href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> and the Tahitians believed that, if a
man refrained from all connection with women some months
before death, he passed immediately into his eternal mansion
without any purification.<a id="FNanchor_879_879" href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> It is perhaps for a similar reason
that the Shawanese have a great respect for certain persons who
observe celibacy,<a id="FNanchor_880_880" href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> and that, among the Californian Karok,
a man who touches a woman within three days before going
out hunting is believed to miss the quarry.<a id="FNanchor_881_881" href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> Among several
peoples, as the Brazilian aborigines,<a id="FNanchor_882_882" href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> the Papuans of New
Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_883_883" href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> certain tribes in Australia,<a id="FNanchor_884_884" href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> the Khyoungtha of the
Chittagong Hills,<a id="FNanchor_885_885" href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> and the Khevsurs of the Caucasus,<a id="FNanchor_886_886" href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a> continence
is required from newly married people for some time
after marriage. The same is the case with several peoples of
Aryan origin; and Dr. v. Schroeder even believes that this
custom can be traced back to the primitive times of the
Indo-European race.<a id="FNanchor_887_887" href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> In ancient Mexico, the Mazatek bridegroom
kept apart from the bride during the first fifteen days
of his wedded life, both spending the time in fasting and penance.<a id="FNanchor_888_888" href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a>
In Greenland, according to Egede, if married couples
had children before a year was past, or if they had large
families, they were blamed, and compared to dogs.<a id="FNanchor_889_889" href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> In Fiji,
husbands and wives do not usually spend the night together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
except as it were by stealth; it is quite contrary to Fijian
ideas of delicacy that they should sleep under the same roof.
Thus a man spends the day with his family, but absents
himself on the approach of night.<a id="FNanchor_890_890" href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> Speaking of certain
American Indians, Lafitau remarks, “Ils n’osent aller dans
les cabanes particulières où habitent leurs épouses, que
durant l’obscurité de la nuit; ... ce seroit une action
extraordinaire de s’y présenter de jour.”<a id="FNanchor_891_891" href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> Moreover, in spite
of the great licentiousness of many savage races, a veil
of modesty, however transparent, is generally drawn over the
relations of the sexes.<a id="FNanchor_892_892" href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a></p>

<p>The same notion of impurity doubtless explains the fact
that certain persons devoted to religion have to live a
single life. In the Marquesas Islands, no one could become a
priest without having lived chastely for several years previously.<a id="FNanchor_893_893" href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a>
In Patagonia, according to Falkner, the male
wizards were not allowed to marry,<a id="FNanchor_894_894" href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> and the same prohibition
applied to the priests of the Mosquito Indians and the ancient
Mexicans.<a id="FNanchor_895_895" href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> In Peru, there were virgins dedicated to the Sun,
who lived in seclusion to the end of their lives; and besides the
virgins who professed perpetual virginity in the monasteries,
there were other women, of the blood royal, who led the same
life in their own houses, having taken a vow of chastity.
“These women,” says Garcilasso de la Vega, “were held in
great veneration for their chastity and purity, and, as a mark
of worship and respect, they were called ‘Occlo,’ which was a
name held sacred in their idolatry.”<a id="FNanchor_896_896" href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> In Mexico, also, certain
religious women were bound to chastity, although their profession
was but for one year. Speaking of these nuns, the
pious Father Acosta remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> “The devil hath desired to be
served by them that observe Virginitie, not that chastitie is
pleasing unto him, for he is an uncleane spirite, but for the
desire he hath to take from the great God, as much as in him
lieth, this glory to be served with cleanness and integrity.”<a id="FNanchor_897_897" href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a>
Justinus tells us of Persian Sun priestesses, who, like the
Roman vestals and certain Greek priestesses, were obliged to
refrain from intercourse with men;<a id="FNanchor_898_898" href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> and according to Pomponius
Mela, the nine priestesses of the oracle of a Gallic deity
in Sena were devoted to perpetual virginity.<a id="FNanchor_899_899" href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></p>

<p>The Buddhistic doctrine teaches that lust and ignorance
are the two great causes of the misery of life, and that we
should therefore suppress lust and remove ignorance. We
read in the ‘Dhammika-Sutta’ that “a wise man should avoid
married life as if it were a burning pit of live coals.”<a id="FNanchor_900_900" href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> Sensuality
is altogether incompatible with wisdom and holiness.
According to the legend, Buddha’s mother, who was the best
and purest of the daughters of men, had no other sons, and
her conception was due to supernatural causes.<a id="FNanchor_901_901" href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> And one
of the fundamental duties of monastic life, by an infringement
of which the guilty person brings about his inevitable
expulsion from Buddha’s Order, is, that “an ordained monk
may not have sexual intercourse, not even with an animal.
The monk who has sexual intercourse is no longer a monk.”<a id="FNanchor_902_902" href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a>
Mr. Wilson, indeed, states that, in Tibet, some sects of the
Lamas are allowed to marry; but those who do not are considered
more holy. And in every sect the nuns must take a
vow of absolute continence.<a id="FNanchor_903_903" href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> Again, the Chinese laws enjoin
celibacy upon all priests, Buddhist or Taouist.<a id="FNanchor_904_904" href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a></p>

<p>In India, where, according to Sir Monier Williams, married
life has been more universally honoured than in any other
country of the world, celibacy has, nevertheless, in instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
of extraordinary sanctity, always commanded respect.<a id="FNanchor_905_905" href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a>
“Those of their Sannyâsis,” says Dubois, “who are known to
lead their lives in perfect celibacy, receive, on that account,
marks of distinguished honour and respect.” But the single
state, which is allowed to those who devote themselves to
a life of contemplation, is not tolerated in any class of
women.<a id="FNanchor_906_906" href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">906</a></p>

<p>Among a small class of Hebrews, too, the idea that marriage
is impure gradually took root. The Essenes, says Josephus,
“reject pleasures as an evil, but esteem continence and the conquest
over our passions to be virtue. They neglect wedlock.”<a id="FNanchor_907_907" href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">907</a>
This doctrine exercised no influence upon Judaism, but probably
much upon Christianity. St. Paul held celibacy to be
preferable to marriage:—“He that giveth his virgin in marriage
doeth well,” he says; “but he that giveth her not in marriage
doeth better.”<a id="FNanchor_908_908" href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> Yet, as for most men continence is not
possible, marriage is for them not only a right but a duty.
“It is good for a man not to touch a woman; nevertheless,
to avoid fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let
each woman have her own husband.... If they (the unmarried
and widows) cannot contain, let them marry: for it is
better to marry than to burn.”<a id="FNanchor_909_909" href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> A much stronger opinion as
to the superiority of celibacy is expressed by most of the
Fathers of the Church. Origen thought marriage profane and
impure. Tertullian says that celibacy must be chosen, even
if mankind should perish. According to St Augustine, the
unmarried children will shine in heaven as beaming stars,
whilst their parents will look like the dim ones.<a id="FNanchor_910_910" href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> Indeed, as
Mr. Lecky observes, the cardinal virtue of the religious type
became the absolute suppression of the whole sensual side of
our nature, and theology made the indulgence of one passion
almost the sole unchristian sin.<a id="FNanchor_911_911" href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> It was a favourite opinion
among the Fathers that, if Adam had preserved his obedience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
to the Creator, he would have lived for ever in a state of virgin
purity, and that some harmless mode of vegetation might
have peopled paradise with a race of innocent and immortal
beings. The use of marriage was in fact permitted to his
fallen posterity only as a necessary expedient for the continuance
of the human species, and as a restraint, however
imperfect, on the natural licentiousness of desire.<a id="FNanchor_912_912" href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> But,
though it may be marriage that fills the earth, says St. Jerome,
it is virginity that replenishes heaven.<a id="FNanchor_913_913" href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">913</a></p>

<p>These opinions led by degrees to the obligatory celibacy of
the secular and regular clergy. The New Testament gives
us no intimation that, during the lifetime of the apostles,
monastic vows were taken by men of any age, or by unmarried
women, and hardly any of the apostles themselves were
celibates.<a id="FNanchor_914_914" href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> But gradually, as continence came to be regarded
as a cardinal virtue, and celibacy as the nearest approach to
the Divine perfection, a notion that the married state is not
consistent with the functions of the clergy became general.
As early as the end of the fourth century, the continence of
the higher grades of ecclesiastics was insisted on by a Roman
synod, but no definite punishment was ordered for its violation.<a id="FNanchor_915_915" href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a>
Gregory VII.—who “looked with abhorrence on the
contamination of the holy sacerdotal character, even in its
lowest degree, by any sexual connection”—was the first who
prescribed with sufficient force the celibacy of the clergy.
Yet, in many countries, it was so strenuously resisted, that
it could not be carried through till late in the thirteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_916_916" href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">916</a></p>

<p>As for the origin of this notion of sexual uncleanness, it
may perhaps be connected with the instinctive feeling, to be
dealt with later on, against intercourse between members of
the same family or household. Experience, I think, tends to
prove that there exists a close association between these two
feelings, which shows itself in many ways. Sexual love is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
entirely banished from the sphere of domestic life, and it is
reasonable to suppose, therefore, that when it appears in other
relations, an association of ideas attaches a notion of impurity
to the desire and a notion of shame to its gratification.
Evidently, also, the religious enforcement of celibacy is
intimately allied to the belief that sexual intercourse is the
great transmitter of original sin, as well as to the abhorrence
of every enjoyment which is considered to degrade the
spiritual nature of man.</p>

<small>THE COURTSHIP OF MAN</small></h2>


<p>Speaking of the male and female reproductive cells of
plants, Professor Sachs remarks that, wherever we are able to
observe an external difference between the two, the male cell
behaves actively in the union, the female passively.<a id="FNanchor_917_917" href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> In this
respect there is an analogy between plants and many of the
lower animals. In the case of some lowly-organised animals,
which are permanently affixed to the same spot, the male
element is invariably brought to the female. There are other
instances in which the females alone are fixed, and the males
must be the seekers. Even when the males and females of a
species are both free, it is almost always the males that first
approach the females.<a id="FNanchor_918_918" href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a></p>

<p>As Mr. Darwin points out, we can see the reason why, in
the first instance, the male plays the active part:—“Even if
the ova were detached before fertilisation, and did not require
subsequent nourishment or protection, there would yet be
greater difficulty in transporting them than the male element
because, being larger than the latter, they are produced in far
smaller numbers.”<a id="FNanchor_919_919" href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> He adds, however, that, with respect to
forms of which the progenitors were primordially free, it is
difficult to understand why the males should invariably have
acquired the habit of approaching the females, instead of
being approached by them. Perhaps the explanation may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
be that the seeker is more exposed to danger than the one
sought after, and that the death of a male at the pairing time
is less disadvantageous for the existence of the species than
the death of a female. At any rate, we may say with
Mr. Darwin that it is necessary that the males should be
endowed with strong passions in order that they may be
efficient seekers; and the acquirement of such passions would
naturally follow from the more eager males leaving a larger
number of offspring than the less eager.<a id="FNanchor_920_920" href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">920</a></p>

<p>The rule holds good for the human race, the man generally
playing a more active, the woman a more passive, part in
courtship. The latter, as it has been said, “requires to be
courted.” Yet, curiously enough, there are a few peoples
among whom the reverse seems to be the case, just as, among
the lower animals also, there are some species of which the
females are the courters.<a id="FNanchor_921_921" href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> Among the Moquis in New
Mexico, according to Dr. Broeck, “instead of the swain
asking the hand of the fair one, she selects the young man
who is to her fancy, and then her father proposes the match
to the sire of the lucky youth.”<a id="FNanchor_922_922" href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> In Paraguay, we are told,
the women were generally endowed with stronger passions
than the men,<a id="FNanchor_923_923" href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> and were allowed to make proposals;<a id="FNanchor_924_924" href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> and
among the Garos, according to Colonel Dalton, it is not only
the privilege but even the duty of the girl to speak first, any
infringement of this rule being summarily and severely
punished. “If a male makes advances to a girl,” he says,
“and the latter, rejecting them, chooses also to tell her
friends that such tenders of affection have been made to
her, it is looked on as an insult to the whole ‘mahári’ (motherhood)
to which the girl belongs, a stain only to be obliterated
by the blood of pigs, and liberal libations of beer at the
expense of the ‘mahári’ to which the man belongs.”<a id="FNanchor_925_925" href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> Ac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>cording
to Mr. Batchelor, it constantly occurs among the Ainos
that the proposal of marriage comes in the first place from the
girl;<a id="FNanchor_926_926" href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> and in Polynesia,<a id="FNanchor_927_927" href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> as also among the Kafirs of Natal<a id="FNanchor_928_928" href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> and
certain tribes in Oregon,<a id="FNanchor_929_929" href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> the same is sometimes the case.</p>

<p>It often happens that the parents of both parties make up
the match; and among several peoples the man pays his suit
by proxy. But these instances are of no particular importance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In most animal species courtship takes place in nearly the
same way. During the season of love, the males even of the
most timid animals engage in desperate combats with each
other for the possession of the female, and she, although
comparatively passive, nevertheless often exercises a choice,
selecting one of the rivals. This fighting for a female occurs
even among insects,<a id="FNanchor_930_930" href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> and is of universal prevalence in the order
of the Vertebrata. We may, with Haeckel, regard it as a
modification and a special kind of the struggle for existence.<a id="FNanchor_931_931" href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">931</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that our primeval human ancestors
had, in the same way, to combat for their brides. Even now
this kind of courtship is far from being unknown. Speaking
of the Northern Indians, Hearne states that “it has ever been
the custom among those people for the men to wrestle for
any woman to whom they are attached; and, of course, the
strongest party always carries off the prize. A weak man,
unless he be a good hunter and well-beloved, is seldom
permitted to keep a wife that a stronger man thinks worth his
notice.... This custom prevails throughout all their tribes,
and causes a great spirit of emulation among their youth, who
are upon all occasions, from their childhood, trying their
strength and skill in wrestling.<a id="FNanchor_932_932" href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> Richardson also saw, more
than once, a stronger man assert his right to take the wife of
a weaker countryman. “Any one,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> “may challenge
another to wrestle, and, if he overcomes, may carry off his wife
as the prize.... The bereaved husband meets his loss with the
resignation which custom prescribes in such a case, and seeks
his revenge by taking the wife of another man weaker than
himself.”<a id="FNanchor_933_933" href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> With reference to the Slave Indians, Mr. Hooper
says, “If a man desire to despoil his neighbour of his wife, a
trial of strength of a curious nature ensues: they seize each
other by the hair, which is worn long and flowing, and thus
strive for the mastery, until one or another cries <i>peccavi</i>.
Should the victor be the envious man, he has to pay a certain
number of skins for the husband-changing woman.”<a id="FNanchor_934_934" href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></p>

<p>Among the Californians also, conflicting claims sometimes
arise between two or more men in regard to a woman; and,
among the Patwin, it occasionally happened that men who
had a quarrel about a woman fought a duel with bows and
arrows at long distances.<a id="FNanchor_935_935" href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> In Mexico, a duel often decided
the conflict between two competing suitors.<a id="FNanchor_936_936" href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> Among the
Guanas, according to Azara, the men frequently do not marry
till they are twenty years old or more, as before that age
they cannot conquer their rivals.<a id="FNanchor_937_937" href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> Among the Muras, the
wives are most commonly gained in a combat with fists
between all the lovers of the girl; and the same is the case
with the Passés.<a id="FNanchor_938_938" href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></p>

<p>Among the Australian aborigines, quarrels are perhaps for
the most part occasioned by “the fair sex.”<a id="FNanchor_939_939" href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> Speaking of the
natives near Herbert Vale, Northern Queensland, Herr
Lumholtz says that, “if a woman is good-looking, all the
men want her, and the one who is most influential, or who is
the strongest, is accordingly generally the victor.”<a id="FNanchor_940_940" href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> Hence,
the majority of the young men must wait a long time before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
they get wives, as they have not the courage to fight the
requisite duel for one with an older man.<a id="FNanchor_941_941" href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> In the tribes of
Western Victoria, described by Mr. Dawson, a young chief
who cannot get a wife, and falls in love with one belonging to
a chief who has more than two, can, with her consent, challenge
the husband to single combat, and, if the husband is
defeated, the conqueror makes her his legal wife.<a id="FNanchor_942_942" href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> Narcisse
Peltier, who, during seventeen years, was detained by a tribe
of Queensland Australians, states that the men “not unfrequently
fight with spears for the possession of a woman.”<a id="FNanchor_943_943" href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a></p>

<p>In New Zealand, if a girl had two suitors with equal pretensions,
a kind of “pulling match” was arranged in which
the girl’s arms were dragged by each of the suitors in opposite
directions, the stronger man being the victor;<a id="FNanchor_944_944" href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> and, according
to the Rev. R. Taylor, there is in the Maori language even a
special term for denoting such a struggle.<a id="FNanchor_945_945" href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> In Samoa, as
also in the Fiji Islands, women have always been one of the
chief causes of fighting;<a id="FNanchor_946_946" href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> and of the natives of Makin, of the
Kingsmill Group, Mr. Wood assures us that “they have no
wars, and very few arms, and seldom quarrel except about
their women.”<a id="FNanchor_947_947" href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a></p>

<p>Among the South African Bushmans, the “stronger man
will sometimes take away the wife of the weaker.”<a id="FNanchor_948_948" href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> The
people of Wadaï are notorious for their desperate fights for
women; and, among the young men of Baghirmi, bloody feuds
between rivals are far from being of rare occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_949_949" href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a></p>

<p>In the islands outside Kamchatka there prevailed formerly
a very curious custom, as reported by Steller. If a husband
found that a rival had been with his wife, he would admit
that the rival had at least an equal claim to her. “Let us
try, then,” he would say, “which of us has the greater right,
and shall have her.” After that they would take off their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
clothes and begin to beat each other’s backs with sticks; and
he who first fell to the ground, unable to bear any more
blows, lost his right to the woman.<a id="FNanchor_950_950" href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">950</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient Hindus, says Mr. Samuelson, “it was a
custom in royal circles, when a princess became marriageable,
for a tournament to be held, and the victor was chosen by
the princess as her husband.” This custom was known as the
“Swayamvara,” or “Maiden’s Choice,” and it is often mentioned
in the ancient legends.<a id="FNanchor_951_951" href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">951</a></p>

<p>In Greek legends and myths, we meet with several instances
of fighting or emulation for women. Pausanias tells
us that Danaus established a race for his daughters, and that
“he that outran all the rest was to have the first choice, and
take her whom he most approved; he that was next in order
was to have the second choice, and so on to the last; and
those who had no suitors were ordered to wait till new ones
came to the course.”<a id="FNanchor_952_952" href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> According to Pindar, Antæus, father
of a fair-haired and greatly-praised daughter, who had many
suitors, stationed the whole company of them at the end of
the race-course, saying that he should have her for his bride
who should prove foremost in the race and first touch her
garments.<a id="FNanchor_953_953" href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> Icarus likewise proposed a race for the suitors
of Penelope;<a id="FNanchor_954_954" href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> and, as Mr. Hamilton remarks, “the triumph
of Odysseus over the Suitors is the real end of the Odyssey.”<a id="FNanchor_955_955" href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a></p>

<p>According to Dr. Krauss, the South Slavonian youths on
Palm Sunday, the day for presentiments of love, wrestle with
each other, believing that he who proves the stronger will get
the prettier wife.<a id="FNanchor_956_956" href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> Arthur Young informs us of the following
strange custom which prevailed in the interior of Ireland in
his time:—“There is a very ancient custom here,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
“for a number of country neighbours among the poor people
to fix upon some young woman that ought, as they think, to
be married; they also agree upon a young fellow as a proper
husband for her; this determined, they send to the fair one’s
cabin to inform her that on the Sunday following ‘she is to
be horsed,’ that is, carried on men’s backs. She must then
provide whisky and cider for a treat, as all will pay her a
visit after mass for a hurling match. As soon as she is
horsed the hurling begins, in which the young fellow appointed
for her husband has the eyes of all the company
fixed on him: if he comes off conqueror, he is certainly
married to the girl; but if another is victorious, he as
certainly loses her, for she is the prize of the victor.... Sometimes
one barony hurls against another, but a marriageable
girl is always the prize.”<a id="FNanchor_957_957" href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sexual struggle in the animal kingdom is not always
of a violent kind. As Mr. Darwin has pointed out, males
often try by peaceful emulation to charm the female. In
many species of birds the male seems to endeavour to gain
his bride by displaying his colours and ornaments before her,
or exciting her by his love-notes, songs, and antics. But
among the lower Mammals he wins her, apparently, much
more through the law of battle than through the display of
his charms.<a id="FNanchor_958_958" href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> There can scarcely be any doubt that the same
was the case with primitive men; but we need not mount
many steps of human progress to find that courtship involves
something more than a mere act of strength or courage on
the part of the male. It is not only in civilized countries
that it often means a prolonged making of love to the
woman. Mariner’s words with reference to the women of
Tonga hold true for a great many, not to say all, savage and
barbarous races now existing. “It must not be supposed,” he
says, “that these women are always easily won; the greatest
attentions and most fervent solicitations are sometimes requisite,
even though there be no other lover in the way. This
happens sometimes from a spirit of coquetry, at other times
from a dislike to the party, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_959_959" href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a></p>

<p>Though generally playing the less active part in courtship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the woman does not by any means indulge in complete
passivity. Mr. Hooper tells us that, among the Indians at
James’s Bay, “two young Indian women were observed some
years ago in violent conflict.... After a lengthened
and determined struggle the weakest succumbed to the
superior prowess of her fortunate adversary. It appeared that
these girls were in love with the same man, and had self-instituted
this mode of deciding their claims.”<a id="FNanchor_960_960" href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> Among the
Wintun of California, according to Mr. Powers, when any
man other than a chief attempts to introduce into his wigwam
a second partner of his bosom, the two women dispute
for the supremacy, often in a desperate pitched battle with
sharp stones; “they maul each other’s faces with savage
violence, and if one is knocked down her friends assist her to
regain her feet, and the brutal combat is renewed until one or
the other is driven from the wigwam.”<a id="FNanchor_961_961" href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> Peltier states that, in
the Australian tribe already referred to, the women, of whom
from two to five commonly belong to each man, fight among
themselves about him, “their weapons being heavy staves,
with which they beat one another about the head till the
blood flows.”<a id="FNanchor_962_962" href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> In the Kingsmill Islands, women sometimes,
from jealousy, carry a small weapon, watching an opportunity
of making an attack upon their rivals, desperate fights being
the consequence;<a id="FNanchor_963_963" href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> and, among the Kamchadales also, the
females are said to have fought for the males.<a id="FNanchor_964_964" href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> But far more
commonly women try to secure men’s love by coquetry or
the display of their charms. Finally, whilst the men are
generally the courters, the women may in many, perhaps
most cases, accept or refuse their proposals at pleasure.</p>

<p>The next chapter will be devoted to an account of some
of the most common means by which the sexes endeavour,
or formerly endeavoured, to make themselves attractive to one
another, and to stimulate each other’s passions. Then we shall
see how far woman has the liberty of disposing of her own
hand, and, at the same time, note cases in which the man also,
with regard to his marriage, has to submit to some other’s will.</p>

<small>MEANS OF ATTRACTION</small></h2>


<p>The desire for self-decoration, although a specifically
human quality, is exceedingly old. There are peoples destitute
of almost everything which we regard as necessaries of life,
but there is no people so rude as not to take pleasure in ornaments.
The ancient barbarians who inhabited the south of
Europe at the same time as the reindeer and the mammoth,
brought to their caves brilliant and ornamental objects.<a id="FNanchor_965_965" href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> The
women of the utterly wretched Veddahs in Ceylon decorate
themselves with necklaces of brass beads, and bangles cut
from the chank shell.<a id="FNanchor_966_966" href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> The Fuegians “are content to be
naked,” but “ambitious to be fine.”<a id="FNanchor_967_967" href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> The Australians, without
taking the slightest pride in their appearance, so far as
neatness or cleanliness is concerned, are yet very vain of their
own rude decorations.<a id="FNanchor_968_968" href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> And of the rude Tasmanians, Cook
tells us that they had no wish to obtain useful articles, but
were eager to secure anything ornamental.</p>

<p>“Great as is the vanity of the civilized,” says Mr. Spencer,
“it is exceeded by that of the uncivilized.”<a id="FNanchor_969_969" href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> The predilection
of savages for ornaments has been sufficiently shown by
travellers in almost every part of the world. Feathers and
beads of different colours, flowers, rings, anklets, and bracelets,
are common embellishments. A fully-equipped Santal belle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
for instance, carries two anklets, and perhaps twelve bracelets,
and a necklace weighing a pound, the total weight of ornaments
on her person amounting to thirty-four pounds of bell
metal,—“a greater weight,” says Captain Sherwill, “than one
of our drawing-room belles could well lift.”<a id="FNanchor_970_970" href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> Besides this, the
body is transformed in various ways. The lips, the sides of
the nose, and the lobes of the ear are especially ill-treated.
Hardly any woman in Eastern Central Africa is without a
lip-ring; they say it makes them look pretty, and “the bigger
the ring, the more they value themselves!”<a id="FNanchor_971_971" href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> The Shulis bore
a hole in the underlip and insert in it a piece of crystal three
or four inches long, which sways about as they speak;<a id="FNanchor_972_972" href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> and
similar customs are common among other African peoples,<a id="FNanchor_973_973" href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a>
as also in some parts of North and South America.<a id="FNanchor_974_974" href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> The
Papuans perforate the septum of the nose and insert in the
hole sticks, claws of birds, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_975_975" href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> The most common practice is
to pierce, enlarge, or somehow mutilate the ear-lobes. Certain
North American Indians,<a id="FNanchor_976_976" href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> the Arecunas and Botocudos of
South America,<a id="FNanchor_977_977" href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> and the East African Wa-taïta<a id="FNanchor_978_978" href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> pull them
down almost to the shoulders. Among the Easter Islanders,
says Beechey, “the lobe, deprived of its ear-ring, hangs dangling
against the neck, and has a very disagreeable appearance,
particularly when wet. It is sometimes so long as to be
greatly in the way; to obviate which, they pass the lobe over
the upper part of the ear, or more rarely, fasten one lobe to
the other, at the back of the head.”<a id="FNanchor_979_979" href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a></p>

<p>Scarcely less subject to mutilations are the teeth. In the
Malay Archipelago, the filing and blackening of the teeth are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
thought to produce a most beautiful result, white teeth being
in great disesteem.<a id="FNanchor_980_980" href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> The Australians often knock out one
or two front teeth of the upper jaw, and several tribes in New
Guinea file their teeth sharp.<a id="FNanchor_981_981" href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> Again, the Damaras file the
middle teeth in the upper jaw into the form of a swallow’s
tail, and knock out four teeth in the lower jaw; whilst one of the
Makalaka tribes, north of the Zambesi, and the Matongas,
on its bank, “break out their top incisor-teeth from the
sheerest vanity. Their women say that it is only horses that
eat with all their teeth, and that men ought not to eat like
horses.”<a id="FNanchor_982_982" href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a></p>

<p>Many savage men take most pride in the hair of the head.
Now it is painted in a showy manner, now decorated with
beads and tinsel, now combed and arranged with the most exquisite
care. The Kandhs have their hair, which is worn very
long, drawn forward and rolled up till it looks like a horn projecting
from between the eyes. Around this it is their delight
to wear a piece of red cloth, and they insert the feathers of
favourite birds, as also a pipe, comb, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_983_983" href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> The men of Tana,
of the New Hebrides, wear their hair “twelve and eighteen
inches long, and have it divided into some six or seven
hundred little locks or tresses;”<a id="FNanchor_984_984" href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> and, among the Latúka, a
man requires a period of from eight to ten years to perfect his
coiffure.<a id="FNanchor_985_985" href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> In North America, Hearne saw several men about
six feet high, who had preserved “a single lock of their hair
that, when let down, would trail on the ground as they walked.”<a id="FNanchor_986_986" href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a>
Other Indians practise the custom of shaving the head and
ornamenting it with the crest of deer’s hairs; and wigs are
used by several savage peoples.<a id="FNanchor_987_987" href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> The Indians of Guiana, the
Fuegians, Chavantes, Uaupés,<a id="FNanchor_988_988" href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> and other tribes are in the
habit of pulling out their eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>Scarcely anything has a greater attraction for the savage
mind than showy colours. “No matter,” says Dr. Holub,
“how ill a traveller in the Marutse district may be, and how
many bearers he may require, if he only has a good stock of
blue beads he may always be sure of commanding the best
attention and of securing the amplest services; his beads will
prove an attraction irresistible to sovereign and subject, to
man, woman, and child, to freeman and bondman alike.”<a id="FNanchor_989_989" href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a>
The practice of ornamenting one’s self with gaudy baubles
and painting the body with conspicuous colours is, indeed,
extremely prevalent. Of Santal men at a feast, Sir W. Hunter
says that, “if all the colours of the rainbow were not displayed
by them, certainly the hedgehog, the peacock, and a variety of
the feathered tribe had been laid under contribution in order
to supply the young Santal beaux with plumes.”<a id="FNanchor_990_990" href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> Especially
does the savage man delight in paint. Red ochre is generally
looked upon as the chief embellishment, whilst, of the other
colours, black and white are probably most in use. The
Naudowessies paint their faces red and black, “which they
esteem as greatly ornamental.”<a id="FNanchor_991_991" href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> Among the Guaycurûs, many
men paint their bodies half red, half white.<a id="FNanchor_992_992" href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> Throughout the
Australian continent the natives stain themselves with black,
red, yellow, and white.<a id="FNanchor_993_993" href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> In Fiji, a small quantity of vermilion
is esteemed “as the greatest possible acquisition.”<a id="FNanchor_994_994" href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> In New
Zealand, the lips of both sexes are generally dyed blue; and
in Santa Cruz, or Egmont Island, Labillardière observed with
surprise that “there was very much diffused a fondness for
white hair, which formed a striking contrast to the colour of
their skin.”<a id="FNanchor_995_995" href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a></p>

<p>“Not one great country can be named,” Mr. Darwin says,
“from the Polar regions in the north to New Zealand in the
south, in which the aborigines do not tattoo themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_996_996" href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
This practice was followed by the ancient Assyrians, Britons,
and Thracians,<a id="FNanchor_997_997" href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> as it is followed by most savages still. And
it may be said without exaggeration that there is no visible
part of the human body, except the eyeball, that has escaped
from being disfigured in this way. Some of the Easter
Islanders tattoo their foreheads in arched lines, as also the
edges of their ears, and the fleshy part of their lips.<a id="FNanchor_998_998" href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> The
Abyssinian women occasionally prick their gums entirely
blue.<a id="FNanchor_999_999" href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> The Mundrucûs tattooed even their eyelids.<a id="FNanchor_1000_1000" href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> And,
speaking of the tattooing of the Sandwich Islanders, Freycinet
remarks, “Aucune partie de leur corps n’en est exempte; le
nez, les oreilles, les paupières, le sommet de la tête, le bout de
la langue même dans quelques circonstances, en sont surchargés
non moins que la poitrine, le dos, les jambes, les bras
et la paume des mains.”<a id="FNanchor_1001_1001" href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a></p>

<p>Often cicatrices are made in the skin, without any colouring
matter being used. Some tribes of Madagascar, for instance,
are in the habit of making marks, “which are intended to be
ornamental,” by slight incisions in the skin.<a id="FNanchor_1002_1002" href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> The natives of
Tana ornament themselves by “cutting or burning some rude
device of a leaf or a fish on the breast, or upper part of the
arm.”<a id="FNanchor_1003_1003" href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> The Australians throughout the continent scar their
persons, as Mr. Curr assures us, only as a means of decoration.<a id="FNanchor_1004_1004" href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a>
And, in Fiji, “rows of wart-like spots are burned along the
arms and backs of the women, which they and their admirers
call ornamental.”<a id="FNanchor_1005_1005" href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that many of these practices sprang
from other motives than a desire for decoration; and some
are said to have had a religious origin. The Australian
Dieyerie, on being asked why he knocks out two front teeth
of the upper jaw of his children, can answer only that, when
they were created, the Muramura, a good spirit, thus disfigured
the first child, and, pleased at the sight, commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
that the like should be done to every male or female child for
ever after.<a id="FNanchor_1006_1006" href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> The Pelew Islanders believe that the perforation
of the septum of the nose is necessary for winning eternal
bliss;<a id="FNanchor_1007_1007" href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> and the Nicaraguans say that their ancestors were instructed
by the gods to flatten the children’s heads.<a id="FNanchor_1008_1008" href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> Again,
in Fiji, it is supposed that the custom of tattooing is in conformity
with the appointment of the god Dengei, and that
its neglect is punished after death.<a id="FNanchor_1009_1009" href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> A similar idea prevails
among the Kingsmill Islanders and Ainos;<a id="FNanchor_1010_1010" href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> and the
Greenlanders formerly believed that the heads of those girls
who had not been deformed by long stitches made with a
needle and black thread between the eyes, on the forehead,
and upon the chin, would be turned into train tubs, and
placed under the lamps in heaven, in the land of souls.<a id="FNanchor_1011_1011" href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a>
But such tales are not of much importance, as any usage
practised from time immemorial may easily be ascribed to
the command of a god.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer suggests that several of the practices here mentioned
are fundamentally connected with totemism.<a id="FNanchor_1012_1012" href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> In order
to put himself more fully under the protection of the totem,
the clansman, according to Mr. Frazer, is in the habit of
assimilating himself to it by the arrangement of his hair and
the mutilation of his body; and of representing the totem on
his body by cicatrices, tattooing, or paint. Thus the Buffalo
clans of the Iowa and Omahas wear two locks of hair in
imitation of horns; whilst the Small Bird clan of the Omahas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
“leave a little hair in front, over the forehead, for a bill, and
some at the back of the head, for the bird’s tail, with much
over each ear for the wings;” and the Turtle subclan cut off
all the hair from a boy’s head, except six locks which are
arranged so as to imitate the legs, head, and tail of a turtle.
The practice of knocking out the upper front teeth at puberty,
Mr. Frazer continues, is, or was once, probably an imitation
of the totem; and so also the bone, reed, or stick which some
Australian tribes thrust through the nose. The Haidahs of
Queen Charlotte Islands have always, and the Iroquois commonly,
their totems tattooed on their persons, and certain
other tribes have on their bodies tattooed figures of animals,
which Mr. Frazer thinks likely to be totem marks. According
to one authority, the raised cicatrices of the Australians
are sometimes arranged in patterns representing the totem;
and, among a few peoples, the totem is painted on the person
of the clansman.<a id="FNanchor_1013_1013" href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a></p>

<p>Mr. Frazer’s theory is supported by exceedingly few facts
whereas there is an enormous mass of cases in which we have
no right whatever to infer a connection with totemism. It is,
indeed, impossible to see how most of the practices considered
in this chapter could have originated in this way. How
is it possible to explain the knocking out of the upper front
teeth or the thrusting of a stick through the nose as imitations
of totem animals? And how are we to connect the mutilations
of the ears and other parts of the body, and the various
modes of self-decoration, with totemism? Since all such practices
are universally considered to improve the appearance,
and, as will be shown presently, take place at the same
period of life, we may justly infer that the cause to which
they owe their origin is fundamentally one and the same.
As for tattooing, Professor Gerland assumes that the tattooed
marks were originally figures of totem animals, though they
are no longer so;<a id="FNanchor_1014_1014" href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> but an assumption of that kind is not permissible
in a scientific investigation. And even in those rare
cases, where a connection between tattooing and totemism
undoubtedly exists, we cannot be sure whether this connection
is not secondary. At present tattooing is everywhere
regarded exclusively, or almost exclusively, as a means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
decoration, and Cook states expressly that, in the South Sea
Islands, at the time of their discovery, it was in no way connected
with religion.<a id="FNanchor_1015_1015" href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> Nor can I agree with Mr. Spencer
that tattooing and other kinds of mutilation were practised
originally as a means of expressing subordination to a dead
ruler or a god.<a id="FNanchor_1016_1016" href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a> Equally without evidence is Mr. Colquhoun’s
opinion that the custom originated in the wish either to make
a man more fearful in battle, or to render the body invulnerable
by the tattooing of charms on it.<a id="FNanchor_1017_1017" href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a></p>

<p>It is true, no doubt, that this practice subserves various
ends. Mr. Keyser speaks of a chief in New Guinea who had
sixty-three blue tattoo lines on his chest, which represented
the number of enemies he had slain.<a id="FNanchor_1018_1018" href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> Moreover, the tattooed
marks make it possible for savages to distinguish their own
clansmen from their enemies;<a id="FNanchor_1019_1019" href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> though I cannot think, with
Chenier,<a id="FNanchor_1020_1020" href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> that this was their original object. Again, many
ornaments are really nothing but trophy-badges, and many
things used for ornaments were at first substitutes for trophies,
having some resemblance to them;<a id="FNanchor_1021_1021" href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> whilst others are carried
as signs of opulence.<a id="FNanchor_1022_1022" href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> I do not deny, either, that men
may sometimes paint their bodies in order to inspire their
enemies with fear in battle, or that the use of red ochre and
fat is good as a defence against changes of weather, flies, and
mosquitoes.<a id="FNanchor_1023_1023" href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> Nevertheless, it seems to be beyond doubt that
men and women began to ornament, mutilate, paint, and
tattoo themselves chiefly in order to make themselves attractive
to the opposite sex,—that they might court successfully,
or be courted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in all parts of the world the desire for
self-decoration is strongest at the beginning of the age of
puberty, all the above-named customs being practised most
zealously at that period of life. Concerning the Dacotahs,
Mr. Prescott states that both sexes adorn themselves at their
courtships to make themselves more attractive, and that “the
young only are addicted to dress.”<a id="FNanchor_1024_1024" href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> The Oráon, according
to Colonel Dalton, is likewise particular about his personal
appearance “only so long as he is unmarried.”<a id="FNanchor_1025_1025" href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> Among the
Let-htas in Indo-China, it is the unmarried youths that are
profusely bedecked with red and white bead necklaces, wild
boars’ tusks, brass armlets, and a broad band of black braid
below the knee.<a id="FNanchor_1026_1026" href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a> Speaking of the Encounter Bay tribe of
South Australia, the Rev. A. Meyer says that “the plucking
out of the beard and anointing with grease and ochre (which
belong to the initiatory ceremony) the men may continue if
they please till about forty years of age, for they consider it
ornamental, and fancy that it makes them look younger, and
gives them an importance in the eyes of the women.”<a id="FNanchor_1027_1027" href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> In
Fiji, says Mr. Anderson, the men, “who like to attract the
attention of the opposite sex, don their best plumage;”<a id="FNanchor_1028_1028" href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> and
when Mr. Bulmer once asked an Australian native why he
wore his adornments, the native answered “that he wore
them in order to look well, and to make himself agreeable to
the women.”<a id="FNanchor_1029_1029" href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a></p>

<p>It is when boys or girls approach puberty that, in the north-west
part of North America, they have their lower lip perforated
for the labret;<a id="FNanchor_1030_1030" href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> that, among the American Eskimo,
the African Masarwas, and certain Australian natives, the
cartilage between the nostrils is pierced for the reception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
a piece of bone, wood, or shell.<a id="FNanchor_1031_1031" href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> At the same age, among
the Chibchas and the aborigines of the Californian Peninsula,
holes were made in the ears.<a id="FNanchor_1032_1032" href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> It is at this period
of life, also, that the Chaymas of New Andalusia, the
Pelew Islanders, and the natives of New Britain have
their teeth blackened, as black teeth, both for men and
women, are considered an indispensable condition of beauty;<a id="FNanchor_1033_1033" href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a>
and that, in several parts of Africa and Australia, they knock
out some teeth, knowing that otherwise they would run the
risk of being refused on account of ugliness.<a id="FNanchor_1034_1034" href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> Among the
Nicobarese, among whom the men blacken their teeth
from the period of puberty, this disfigurement is indeed so
favourably regarded by the fair sex that a woman “would
scorn to accept the addresses of one possessing white teeth,
like a dog or pig.”<a id="FNanchor_1035_1035" href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> Mr. Crawfurd tells us that, in the Malay
Archipelago, the practice of filing and blackening the teeth,
already referred to, is a necessary prelude to marriage, the
common way of expressing the fact that a girl has arrived at
puberty being that “she has had her teeth filed.”<a id="FNanchor_1036_1036" href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> And, with
reference to some of the natives of the Congo countries,
Tuckey states that the two upper front teeth are filed by the
men, so as to make a large opening, and scars are raised on
the skin, both being intended by the men as ornamental, and
“principally done with the idea of rendering themselves
agreeable to the women.”<a id="FNanchor_1037_1037" href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a></p>

<p>The important part played by the hair of the head as a
stimulant of sexual passion appears in a curious way from
Mr. Sibree’s account of King Radàma’s attempt to introduce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
European customs among the Hovas of Madagascar. As
soon as he had adopted the military tactics of the English, he
ordered that all his officers and soldiers should have their
hair cut; but this command produced so great a disturbance
among the women of the capital that they assembled in great
numbers to protest against the king’s order, and could not be
quieted till they were surrounded by troops and their leaders
cruelly speared.<a id="FNanchor_1038_1038" href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> Everywhere it is the young and unmarried
people who are most anxious to dress their hair.<a id="FNanchor_1039_1039" href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> Thus,
among the Bunjogees, a Chittagong Hill tribe, the young men
“stuff a large ball of black cotton into their topknot to
make it look bigger.”<a id="FNanchor_1040_1040" href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> In the Tenimber Group, the lads
decorate their long locks with leaves, flowers, and feathers, as
Riedel says, “only in order to please the women.”<a id="FNanchor_1041_1041" href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> Among
the Tacullies, “the elderly people neglect to ornament their
heads, in the same manner as they do the rest of their persons,
and generally wear their hair short. But the younger people
of both sexes, who feel more solicitous to make themselves
agreeable to each other, wash and paint their faces and let
their hair grow long.”<a id="FNanchor_1042_1042" href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> And in the Admiralty Islands, according
to Professor Moseley, “only the young men of apparently
from eighteen to thirty, or so, wear the hair long and combed
out into a mop or bush,” whilst the boys or older men wear
the hair short.<a id="FNanchor_1043_1043" href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>Passing to the practice of painting the body: Dr. Sparrman
tells us that the two Hottentots whom he had in his service,
when they expected to meet some girls of their own
nation, painted their noses, cheeks, and the middle of the
forehead with soot.<a id="FNanchor_1044_1044" href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> On Flinders Island, whither the remnant
of the Tasmanians were removed, a rebellion nearly burst out
when orders were once issued forbidding the use of ochre
and grease, for “the young men feared the loss of favour in the
eyes of their countrywomen.”<a id="FNanchor_1045_1045" href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> Among the Guarayos, the
suitor, when courting, keeps for some days close to the cabin
of the mistress of his heart, he being painted from head to
foot, and armed with his battle club.<a id="FNanchor_1046_1046" href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a> In certain parts of
Australia, when a boy arrives at the age of puberty, his hair,
body, and limbs are profusely smeared with red ochre and
fat, this being one of the rites by which he is initiated into
the privileges of manhood.<a id="FNanchor_1047_1047" href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> Again, with reference to the
Ahts, Mr. Sproat remarks that “some of the young men
streak their faces with red, but grown-up men seldom now
use paint, unless on particular occasions.” The women cease
to use it about the age of twenty-five.<a id="FNanchor_1048_1048" href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a></p>

<p>The girls are generally painted when they arrive at the
epoch of the first menstruation.<a id="FNanchor_1049_1049" href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a> Thus, among certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Equatorial Africans, they are rubbed with black, red, and
white paints in the course of a ceremony which, according to
Mr. Reade, is essentially of a Phallic nature.<a id="FNanchor_1050_1050" href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> If a young
maiden of the Tapoyers of Brazil “be marriageable, and yet
not courted by any, the mother paints her with some red
colour about the eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_1051_1051" href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a></p>

<p>The act of tattooing, also, generally takes place at the age of
puberty, in the case of men as well as in that of women. It
is about that period that, in the underlip of all freeborn
female Thlinkets, “a slit is made parallel with the mouth,
and about half an inch below it;”<a id="FNanchor_1052_1052" href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> that, among the Eskimo,
pigments of various dye are pricked on the chin, at the angles
of the mouth, and across the face over the cheek-bones;<a id="FNanchor_1053_1053" href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> that,
in some South American tribes, incisions are made from the
shoulders of the girl to her waist, “when she is regarded as a
delicious morsel for the arms of an ardent lover.”<a id="FNanchor_1054_1054" href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> At the
same age, either or both sexes are subject to tattooing among
the Guarayos,<a id="FNanchor_1055_1055" href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> Abipones,<a id="FNanchor_1056_1056" href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> Baris,<a id="FNanchor_1057_1057" href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> Gonds,<a id="FNanchor_1058_1058" href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> Dyaks,<a id="FNanchor_1059_1059" href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> Negritos
of the Philippines,<a id="FNanchor_1060_1060" href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> South Sea Islanders,<a id="FNanchor_1061_1061" href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> Australians,<a id="FNanchor_1062_1062" href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> &amp;c.
Among the Nagas of Upper Assam, it was the custom “to
allow matrimony to those only who made themselves as
hideous as possible by having their faces elaborately tattooed.”<a id="FNanchor_1063_1063" href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
The Makalaka girls, before they could marry, had to submit
to horrible torture, about four thousand stitches being made
in the skin of the chest and stomach, and a black fluid being
rubbed into the wounds.<a id="FNanchor_1064_1064" href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> In New Zealand, according to the
Rev. R. Taylor, it was the great ambition of the young to
have fine tattooed faces, “both to render themselves attractive
to the ladies, and conspicuous in war.”<a id="FNanchor_1065_1065" href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> In Samoa, until
a young man was tattooed, he could not think of marriage,
but as soon as this was done, he considered himself entitled to
all the privileges of mature years.<a id="FNanchor_1066_1066" href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> “When it is all over,” says
Mr. Pritchard, “and the youths thoroughly healed, a grand
dance is got up on the first available pretext to display
the tattooing, when the admiration of the fair sex is unsparingly
bestowed. And this is the great reward, long and
anxiously looked forward to by the youths as they smart
under the hands of the ‘matai.’”<a id="FNanchor_1067_1067" href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> Often, however, the operation
is accomplished not at once, but at different times, that the
patients may be able to bear the inflammation and pain at
every stage of the process; and not unfrequently it begins
when the girls are quite young children, being constantly
added to until they marry.<a id="FNanchor_1068_1068" href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a></p>

<p>The real object of the custom is shown also by several other
statements. When Mertens asked the natives of Lukunor
what was the meaning of tattooing, one of them answered,
“It has the same object as your clothes, that is, to please the
women.”<a id="FNanchor_1069_1069" href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> Bancroft remarks that young Kadiak wives “secure
the affectionate admiration of their husbands by tattooing the
breast and adorning the face with black lines.”<a id="FNanchor_1070_1070" href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a> The raised
cuts of the Australians, according to Mr. Palmer, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> “merely
ornamental and convey no idea of tribal connection,” the
women marking themselves in this manner “to add to their
looks, and to make themselves attractive.”<a id="FNanchor_1071_1071" href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> Barrington assures
us that, among the natives of Botany Bay, “scars are, by both
sexes, deemed highly ornamental;”<a id="FNanchor_1072_1072" href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> and, in the Eucla tribe,
according to Mr. W. Williams, both sexes make horizontal
scars on the chest and vertical scars on the upper arm “for the
purpose of ornamentation.”<a id="FNanchor_1073_1073" href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> In Ponapé, as we are informed
by von Kubary and Finsch, tattooing is practised only as a
means of improving the appearance;<a id="FNanchor_1074_1074" href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> and, in New Guinea, the
women tattoo themselves “to please the men.”<a id="FNanchor_1075_1075" href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> Bock remarks,
“As the Dyak women are tattooed to please their lovers, so
the Laos men undergo the ordeal for the sake of the women.”<a id="FNanchor_1076_1076" href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a></p>

<p>In Samoa, great licentiousness was connected with the
custom of tattooing; and, in Tahiti, the chiefs prohibited it
altogether on account of the obscene practices by which it
was invariably accompanied in that island.<a id="FNanchor_1077_1077" href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> The Tahitians
have also a very characteristic tale of its origin. Taaroa, their
god, and Apouvaru had a daughter, who was called Hinaeree-remonoi.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
“As she grew up, in order to preserve her chastity,
she was made ‘pahio,’ or kept in a kind of enclosure, and constantly
attended by her mother. Intent on her seduction, the
brothers invented tattooing, and marked each other with the
figure called Taomaro. Thus ornamented, they appeared
before their sister, who admired the figures, and, in order to be
tattooed herself, eluding the care of her mother, broke the
enclosure that had been erected for her preservation, was
tattooed, and became also the victim to the designs of her
brothers. Tattooing thus originated among the gods, and
was first practised by the children of Taaroa, their principal
deity. In imitation of their example, and for the accomplishment
of the same purposes, it was practised among men....
The two sons of Taaroa and Apouvaru were the gods of
tattooing. Their images were kept in the temples of those
who practised the art professionally, and every application of
their skill was preceded by a prayer addressed to them, that
the operation might not occasion death, that the wounds
might soon heal, that the figures might be handsome, attract
admirers, and answer the ends of wickedness designed.”<a id="FNanchor_1078_1078" href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a></p>

<p>This legend is especially instructive because it shows how a
custom which had originally nothing to do with religion may
in time take a more or less religious character. Professor
Wundt holds that, in most cases, religious ideas are the
original sources from which customs flow;<a id="FNanchor_1079_1079" href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> but it is far more
probable that the connection between religion and custom is
often secondary. Nearly every practice which for some reason
or other has come into fashion and taken root among the
people, is readily supposed to have a divine sanction; and
this is one of the reasons why conservatism as to religion is
so often accompanied by conservatism in other matters.
This must especially be the case among savage men who
identify their ancestors with their gods, and consequently
look upon ancient customs as divine institutions.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, difficult to believe that the motives which gave
rise to tattooing can have been different from those which led
to the painting of the body. The chief distinction between
the two is, that the tattooed marks are indelible, being neither
extinguished nor rendered fainter by lapse of time. Hence
the prevalence of tattooing may be explained by a general
desire among savages to make the decorations of the body
permanent. Sometimes, too, the custom seems to be kept up
as a test of courage.<a id="FNanchor_1080_1080" href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a></p>

<p>Even to European tastes the incised lines and figures have
in many cases a certain beauty. Thus, speaking of the
Gambier Islanders, Beechey assures us that the tattooing
undoubtedly improves their appearance; and Yate remarks
that “nothing can exceed the beautiful regularity with which
the faces and thighs of the New Zealanders are tattooed,” the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
volutes being perfect specimens, and the regularity mechanically
correct.<a id="FNanchor_1081_1081" href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> Forster observed that, among the natives of
Waitahoo (Marquesas Islands), the punctures were disposed
with the utmost care, so that the marks on each leg, arm, and
cheek and on the corresponding muscles were exactly similar.<a id="FNanchor_1082_1082" href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a>
Among the Tahitians, according to Darwin, the ornaments
follow the curvature of the body so gracefully, that they have
a very pleasing and elegant effect; and, among the Easter
Islanders, “all the lines were drawn with much taste, and
carried in the direction of the muscle.”<a id="FNanchor_1083_1083" href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> The fact that the
tattooed lines follow closely the natural forms of the body in
order to render them more conspicuous, has been observed in
the case of other peoples also,<a id="FNanchor_1084_1084" href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> and it would be ridiculous to
regard such marks as transformed images of gods.</p>

<p>The facts stated seem to show that the object of tattooing,<a id="FNanchor_1085_1085" href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a>
as well as of other kinds of self-decoration or mutilation, was
to stimulate the sexual desire of the opposite sex. To us it
appears strange that such repugnant practices as that of
perforating the septum of the nose or removing teeth should
owe their origin to coquetry, but we must not judge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
taste of savages by our own. In this case the desire for self-decoration
is to a great extent identical with the wish to
attract attention, to excite by means of the charm of novelty.<a id="FNanchor_1086_1086" href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a>
At all stages of civilization people like a slight variety, but
deviations from what they are accustomed to see must not
be too great, nor of such a kind as to provoke a disagreeable
association of ideas. In Cochin China, where the women
blacken their teeth, a man said of the wife of the English
Ambassador contemptuously that “she had white teeth like
a dog;”<a id="FNanchor_1087_1087" href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> and the Abipones in South America, who carefully
plucked out all the hairs with which our eyes are naturally
protected, despised the Europeans for their thick eyebrows,
and called them brothers to the ostriches, who have very
thick brows.<a id="FNanchor_1088_1088" href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> We, on the other hand, would dislike to see a
woman with a crystal or a piece of wood in her lip.</p>

<p>It is a common notion that women are by nature vainer
and more addicted to dressing and decorating themselves
than men. This certainly does not hold good for savage and
barbarous peoples in general. It is true that, among many of
them, tattooing is exclusively or predominantly limited to
the women, and that the men sometimes wear fewer ornaments.
But several travellers, as for instance Dr. Schweinfurth<a id="FNanchor_1089_1089" href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> and
Dr. Barth,<a id="FNanchor_1090_1090" href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> who have a vast experience of African races,
agree that the reverse is usually the case. The women of
all the tribes of Indians Richardson saw on his route through
the northern parts of the fur countries, adorned their persons
less than the men of the same tribes; and the like is said of
the Comanches.<a id="FNanchor_1091_1091" href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> Among the Uaupés, Mr. Wallace observed
“that the men and boys appropriated all the ornaments.”<a id="FNanchor_1092_1092" href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
The native women of Orangerie Bay of New Guinea, except
that they are tattooed, adorn themselves less than the men,
and none of them paint their faces and bodies, as the men
frequently do.<a id="FNanchor_1093_1093" href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> In the Admiralty Islands, young girls
“sometimes have a necklace or two on, but they never are
decorated to the extent to which the men are,” it being
evidently not considered good taste for them to adorn their
persons.<a id="FNanchor_1094_1094" href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a> Among the aborigines of the New Hebrides, New
Hanover, New Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_1095_1095" href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> and Australia,<a id="FNanchor_1096_1096" href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> adornments are almost
entirely monopolised by the men, the “fair sex” being content
with their natural charms.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the plainer appearance of the
women depends upon their oppressed and despised position,
as well as upon the selfishness of the men.<a id="FNanchor_1097_1097" href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a> But it is doubtful
whether this is the true explanation. Savage ornaments,
generally speaking, are not costly things, and even where
the state of women is most degraded a woman may, if she
pleases, paint her body with red ochre or put a piece of wood
through her lip or a feather through the cartilage of the nose.
In Eastern Central Africa, for instance, the women are more
decorated than the men, although they hold an inferior
position, being viewed as beasts of burden, and doing all the
harder work. “A woman,” says Mr. Macdonald, “always
kneels when she has occasion to talk to a man.”<a id="FNanchor_1098_1098" href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> Almost
the same is said of the female Indians of Guiana;<a id="FNanchor_1099_1099" href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> whereas in
the Yule Island, on the Coast of New Guinea, and in New
Hanover, the women are less given to personal adornment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
than the men, although they are held in respect, have influence
in their families, and exercise, in some villages, much authority,
or even supremacy.<a id="FNanchor_1100_1100" href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a></p>

<p>Of all the various kinds of self-ornamentation tattooing is
the most laborious. Yet, in Melanesia, it is chiefly women
that are tattooed, though they are treated as slaves; whilst in
Polynesia, where the <i>status</i> of women is comparatively good,
this practice is mainly confined to the men.<a id="FNanchor_1101_1101" href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> In Fiji, where
women were fearfully oppressed, genuine tattooing was found
on them only.<a id="FNanchor_1102_1102" href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a></p>

<p>It is expressly stated of the women of several savage
peoples that they are less desirous of self-decoration than the
men. Speaking of the Aleuts on the Fur-Seal Islands of
Alaska, Mr. Elliott says, “In these lower races there is much
more vanity displayed by the masculine element than the
feminine, according to my observation; in other words, I
have noticed a greater desire among the young men than
among the young women of savage and semi-civilised people
to be gaily dressed, and to look fine.”<a id="FNanchor_1103_1103" href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> Among the Gambier
Islanders, according to Beechey, the women “have no ornaments
of any kind, and appeared quite indifferent to the
beads and trinkets which were offered them.”<a id="FNanchor_1104_1104" href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> In Tierra del
Fuego, Lieutenant Bove found the men more desirous of
ornaments than the women; and Proyart made a similar
observation with regard to the people of Loango.<a id="FNanchor_1105_1105" href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> Again,
touching the Crees, Mackenzie remarks that “the women,
though by no means inattentive to the decoration of their
own persons, appear to have a still greater degree of pride
attending to the appearance of the men, whose faces are
painted with more care than those of the women.”<a id="FNanchor_1106_1106" href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></p>

<p>It is difficult, then, to believe that the inferior position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the weaker sex accounts for the comparative scarcity of
female ornaments. The fact may to some extent be explained
by Mr. Spencer’s suggestion, that ornaments have
partly originated from trophy-badges, and Professor Wundt’s,
that they indicate rank and fortune: but these explanations
apply only to a few cases. If it be true that man began to
decorate himself chiefly in order to stimulate the passions of
the opposite sex, we may conclude that the vanity of the
men is, in the first place, due to the likings of the women,
and that the plainer appearance of the women is a consequence
of the men’s greater indifference to their ornaments.
Mr. Darwin has shown that, among our domesticated quadrupeds,
individual antipathies and preferences are exhibited
much more commonly by the female than by the male,<a id="FNanchor_1107_1107" href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> and
the same, as we shall see, is in some measure the case with
man also. It is the women rather than the men that have
to be courted. Thus, with reference to the natives of Gippsland,
Mr. Brough Smyth, on the authority of Mr. Bulmer,
states, “The ornaments worn by the females were not much
regarded by the men. The woman did little to improve her
appearance; ... if her physical aspect was such as to
attract admirers she was content.”<a id="FNanchor_1108_1108" href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a></p>

<p>It should also be noted that among savages it is, as a rule,
the man only that runs the risk of being obliged to lead a
single life. Hence it is obvious that to the best of his ability
he must endeavour to be taken into favour by making himself
as attractive as possible. In civilized Europe, on the other
hand, the opposite occurs. Here it is the woman that has
the greatest difficulty in getting married—and she is also the
vainer of the two.</p>

<p>The hypothesis as to the origin of the customs in question,
set forth in this chapter, presupposes of course that savage
girls enjoy great liberty in the choice of a mate. It will be
seen subsequently that there can be no doubt as to the
accuracy of that presumption.</p>

<p>At a higher stage of civilization the tendency of mankind
is to give up savage ornaments, and no longer to regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
mutilations of the body as improving the appearance. In
Persia, women still wear the nose-ring through one side of the
nostril,<a id="FNanchor_1109_1109" href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> but to a European such a custom would be extremely
displeasing. In the Western world the ear-ring is the last
vanishing relic of savage taste.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the naked body the ornaments were transferred to
clothing, partly because climate made clothes necessary,
partly for another reason. “A savage begins,” Professor
Moseley says, “by painting or tattooing himself for ornament.
Then he adopts a movable appendage, which he hangs on
his body, and on which he puts the ornamentation which he
formerly marked more or less indelibly on his skin. In this
way he is able to gratify <i>his taste for change</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_1110_1110" href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a></p>

<p>It is usually said that man began to cover his body for
two reasons: first, to protect himself from frost and damp;
secondly, on account of a feeling of shame.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, when man emigrated from his
warm native home and settled down in less hospitable zones,
it became necessary for him to screen himself from the influences
of a raw climate. The Eskimo wrap themselves up in
furs, and the wretched natives of Tierra del Fuego throw a
piece of sealskin over one of their shoulders, “on the side from
which the wind blows.”<a id="FNanchor_1111_1111" href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a></p>

<p>The second motive, too, seems acceptable at first sight.
The savage men of the tropics, though otherwise entirely
naked, commonly wear a scanty dress which Europeans might
readily suppose to be used for the sake of decency. Nothing
of the sort is found in any other animal species; hence
Professor Wundt concludes that shame is “a feeling specifically
peculiar to man.”<a id="FNanchor_1112_1112" href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a></p>

<p>But why should man blush to expose one part of the body
more than another? This is no matter of course, but a
problem to be solved.</p>

<p>The feeling in question cannot be regarded as originally
innate in mankind. There are many peoples, who, though
devoid of any kind of dress, show no trace of shame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and others who, when they dress themselves, pay not the
least regard to what we consider the first requirements
of decency.</p>

<p>Thus, in the northern parts of the Californian Peninsula,
both men and women have been found in a state of nudity.<a id="FNanchor_1113_1113" href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a>
Among the Miwok, according to their own confession, persons
of both sexes and of all ages were formerly absolutely naked.<a id="FNanchor_1114_1114" href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a>
Lyman found the same to be the case with the Paiuches in
northern Colorado, Columbus with the aborigines of Hispaniola,
Pizarro with the Indians of Coca, v. Humboldt with the
Chaymas, Wallace with the Purupurús, v. Schütz-Holzhausen
with the Catamixis, Prince Maximilian with the Puris at St.
Fidelis, Azara with certain Indians in the neighbourhood of
the river Paraguay.<a id="FNanchor_1115_1115" href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> In some Indian tribes the men alone go
naked,<a id="FNanchor_1116_1116" href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> in others the women.<a id="FNanchor_1117_1117" href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> Again, in North America,
Mackenzie met a troop of natives, of whom the men wore
many ornaments and much clothing, but had, apparently, not
the slightest notion of bashfulness. And of the Fuegians we
are told that, although they have the shoulder or the back
protected by a sealskin, the rest of the body is perfectly
naked.<a id="FNanchor_1118_1118" href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a></p>

<p>The men of most Australian tribes, and in many cases the
women, wear no clothes except in cold weather, when they
throw a kangaroo skin about their shoulders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> “They are as
innocent of shame,” says Mr. Palmer, “as the animals of the
forests.”<a id="FNanchor_1119_1119" href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a> In Tasmania, too, the aborigines were usually naked,
or, when they covered themselves, they showed that the idea
of decency had not occurred to them.<a id="FNanchor_1120_1120" href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a> The same is said
of some tribes in Borneo<a id="FNanchor_1121_1121" href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> and Sumatra,<a id="FNanchor_1122_1122" href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> the people of Jarai,
bordering upon the empire of Siam,<a id="FNanchor_1123_1123" href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> the inhabitants of the
Louisiade Archipelago,<a id="FNanchor_1124_1124" href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> Solomon Islands,<a id="FNanchor_1125_1125" href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a> Penrhyn Island,
and some other islands of the South Sea;<a id="FNanchor_1126_1126" href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> whilst, in others,
only the men generally go naked.<a id="FNanchor_1127_1127" href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> The Papuans of the south-west
coast of New Guinea “glory in their nudeness, and
consider clothing to be fit only for women.”<a id="FNanchor_1128_1128" href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> In one part
of Timor, on the other hand,<a id="FNanchor_1129_1129" href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> as also in a tribe of the Andamanese,<a id="FNanchor_1130_1130" href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a>
it is the women that are devoid of any kind of
covering.</p>

<p>Passing to Africa, we meet with instances of the same
kind. Concerning the Wa-taveita of the eastern equatorial
region, Mr. Johnston remarks that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> “both sexes have
little notion or conception of decency, the men especially
seeming to be unconscious of any impropriety in nakedness.
What clothing they have is worn as an adornment or for
warmth at night and early morning.”<a id="FNanchor_1131_1131" href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> The Wa-chaga and
Mashukulumbe generally go about naked,<a id="FNanchor_1132_1132" href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> and so do the
Bushmans, except when they use a piece of skin barely sufficient
to cover the back.<a id="FNanchor_1133_1133" href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> Again, among the Bubis of Fernando
Po<a id="FNanchor_1134_1134" href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> and the natives of Balonda<a id="FNanchor_1135_1135" href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> and Loango,<a id="FNanchor_1136_1136" href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> the
women have no sort of covering, whilst, among the Negroes of
the Egyptian Soudan,<a id="FNanchor_1137_1137" href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> the Baris,<a id="FNanchor_1138_1138" href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> Shilluk,<a id="FNanchor_1139_1139" href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> Dinka,<a id="FNanchor_1140_1140" href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> Watuta,<a id="FNanchor_1141_1141" href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a>
and Masai,<a id="FNanchor_1142_1142" href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> this is the case with the men only. Apud
Masaios membrum virile celare turpe existimatur, honestum
expromere, atque etiam ostentare.<a id="FNanchor_1143_1143" href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> In Lancerote also, according
to Bontier and Le Verrier, the men used no covering;
and, in Teneriffe, “the inhabitants went naked, except some
few who wore goatskins.”<a id="FNanchor_1144_1144" href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a></p>

<p>It might perhaps be supposed that the feeling of modesty,
though not originally innate, appeared later on, at a certain
stage of civilization, either spontaneously or from some
unknown cause. This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of
Professor Wundt, who says that man began to cover himself
from decency.<a id="FNanchor_1145_1145" href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a> But let us see what covering savages often
use.</p>

<p>A fashionable young Wintun woman, says Mr. Powers,
wears a girdle of deer-skin, the lower edge of which is slit
into a long fringe with a polished pine-nut at the end of each
strand, while the upper border and other portions are studded
with brilliant bits of shell.<a id="FNanchor_1146_1146" href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> The Botocudos use a covering
which has little resemblance to a garment; and their neighbours,
the Patachos and Machacaris, make this trifle still smaller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
a thread being sufficient clothing, according to their notion
of modesty.<a id="FNanchor_1147_1147" href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> When a Carib girl attained the age of ten or
twelve years, she assumed around the waist “a piece of cotton
cloth worked and embroidered with minute grains of shells
of different colours, decorated in the lower part with fringe.”<a id="FNanchor_1148_1148" href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a>
Similar ornamental skirts are in use among the Macusís,
Arawaks, and other South American peoples.<a id="FNanchor_1149_1149" href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> Among the
Guaycurûs, the men had no covering, except a narrow bandage
round the loins, which was of coloured cotton, and often
adorned with glass beads.<a id="FNanchor_1150_1150" href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> The Australians of Port Essington
occasionally wear girdles of finely twisted human hair,
and the men sometimes add a tassel of the hair of the
opossum or flying squirrel, suspended in front.<a id="FNanchor_1151_1151" href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a> The women
on the Lower Murray manufacture round mats of grass or
reeds, which they fasten upon their backs, “tying them in
front, so that they almost resemble the shell of a tortoise.”<a id="FNanchor_1152_1152" href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a>
In Tahiti, a “maro,” composed of red and yellow feathers, was
considered a present of very great value, and the women
thought it “most ornamental” to enfold their loins with many
windings of cloth.<a id="FNanchor_1153_1153" href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> Dr. Seemann states that, in Fiji, the girls
“wore nothing save a girdle of hibiscus-fibres, about six
inches wide, dyed black, red, yellow, white, or brown, and put
on in such a coquettish way, that one thought it must come
off every moment.”<a id="FNanchor_1154_1154" href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> A similar practice is common in the
islands of the Pacific, fringes made of cocoa-nut fibre or of
leaves slit into narrow strips or filaments of bark, frequently
dyed with gaudy colours, being, in most of these islands, the
only garment of the natives. This costume, with its conspicuous
tint and mobile fringe, has a most graceful appearance
and a very pretty effect, but is far from being in
harmony with our ideas of modesty. In the island of Yap,
according to Cheyne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> “the dress of the males, if such it may
be called, is slovenly in the extreme. They wear the ‘maro’
next them, and, by way of improvement, a bunch of bark
fibres dyed red, over it.”<a id="FNanchor_1155_1155" href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> In New Caledonia, in Forster’s
time, the natives only tied “a string round the middle and
another round the neck;”<a id="FNanchor_1156_1156" href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> whilst, in some other groups, the
costume of the men consisted of nothing but a leaf,<a id="FNanchor_1157_1157" href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> a
mussel,<a id="FNanchor_1158_1158" href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> or a shell.<a id="FNanchor_1159_1159" href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a></p>

<p>In Sumatra, according to Marsden, young women, before
they are of an age to be clothed, have a plate of silver in the
shape of a heart hung in front by a chain of the same metal.<a id="FNanchor_1160_1160" href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a>
Among the Garos of Bengal, the women wear merely a very
short piece of striped blue cotton round the waist. The men
have a very narrow waist-cloth tied behind and then brought
up between the legs; the portion hanging over in front is
sometimes adorned with brass boss-like ornaments, and white
long-shaped beads.<a id="FNanchor_1161_1161" href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a> In Lukungu, the entire covering of most
of the women consists of a narrow string with some white
china beads threaded on it.<a id="FNanchor_1162_1162" href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> The Hottentot women, according
to Barrow, bestowed their largest and most splendid
ornaments upon the little apron, about seven or eight inches
wide, that hung from the waist. “Great pains,” he says,
“seem to be taken by the women to attract notice towards
this part of their persons. Large metal buttons, shells of the
cypræa genus, with the apertures outwards, or anything that
makes a great show, are fastened to the borders of this
apron.”<a id="FNanchor_1163_1163" href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> The Bushman women of South Africa, met with
by the same traveller, had as their only covering a belt of
springbok’s skin, the part which was intended to hang in
front being cut into long threads. But the filaments, he
says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> “were so small and thin that they answered no sort of
use as a covering; nor, indeed, did the females, either old or
young, seem to feel any sense of shame in appearing before
us naked.”<a id="FNanchor_1164_1164" href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a> And among the Negroes of Benin, according to
Bosman, the girls had no other garment than some strings of
coral twisted about the middle.<a id="FNanchor_1165_1165" href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a></p>

<p>It seems utterly improbable that such “garments” owe
their origin to the feeling of shame. Their ornamental
character being obvious, there can be but little doubt that men
and women originally, at least in many cases, covered themselves
not from modesty, but on the contrary, in order to
make themselves more attractive—the men to women, and
the women to men.</p>

<p>In a state where all go perfectly nude, nakedness must
appear quite natural, for what we see day after day makes no
special impression upon us. But when one or another—whether
man or woman—began to put on a bright-coloured
fringe, some gaudy feathers, a string with beads, a bundle of
leaves, a piece of cloth, or a dazzling shell, this could not of
course escape the attention of the others; and the scanty covering
was found to act as the most powerful attainable sexual
stimulus.<a id="FNanchor_1166_1166" href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> Hence the popularity of such garments in the
savage world.</p>

<p>Several travellers have noticed that there is nothing indecent
in absolute nakedness when the eyes have got accustomed to it.
“Where all men go naked, as for instance in New Holland,”
says Forster, “custom familiarizes them to each other’s eyes,
as much as if they went wholly muffled up in garments.”<a id="FNanchor_1167_1167" href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a>
Speaking of a Port Jackson woman who was entirely uncovered,
Captain Hunter remarks, “There is such an air of innocence
about her that clothing scarcely appears necessary.”<a id="FNanchor_1168_1168" href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>
With reference to the Uupés, Mr. Wallace records his
opinion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> “there is far more immodesty in the transparent
and flesh-coloured garments of our stage-dancers, than in the
perfect nudity of these daughters of the forest.”<a id="FNanchor_1169_1169" href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> In his
‘Africa Unveiled’ Mr. Rowley remarks, “When the sight
becomes accustomed to the absence of raiment, your sense of
propriety is far less offended than in England, where ample
clothing is made the vehicle for asserting defiance, if not of
actual law, yet of the wishes and feelings of the more virtuous
part of the community.”<a id="FNanchor_1170_1170" href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> And, speaking of the Fuegians,
Captain Snow says, “More harm, I think, is done by false
modesty,—by covering and <i>partly</i> clothing, than by the truth
in nature always appearing as it is. Intermingling with
savages of wild lands who do not clothe, gives one, I believe,
less impure and sensual feelings than the merely mixing with
society of a higher kind.”<a id="FNanchor_1171_1171" href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a></p>

<p>The same view is taken by Dr. Zimmermann,<a id="FNanchor_1172_1172" href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a> and by Mr.
Reade, who, with reference to the natives of Central Africa,
remarks that there is nothing voluptuous in the excessive
<i>déshabillé</i> of an equatorial girl, nothing being so moral and
so unlikely to excite the passions as nakedness.<a id="FNanchor_1173_1173" href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> Speaking
of the Wa-chaga, Mr. Johnston observes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> “We should be apt
to call, from our point of view, their nakedness and almost
unconsciousness of shame indelicate, but it is rather, when
one gets used to it, a pleasing survival of the old innocent
days when prurient thoughts were absent from the mind
of man.”<a id="FNanchor_1174_1174" href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a> As a careful observer remarks,<a id="FNanchor_1175_1175" href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> true modesty
lies in the entire absence of thought upon the subject.
Among medical students and artists the nude causes no extraordinary
emotion; indeed, Flaxman asserted that the
students in entering the academy seem to hang up their
passions along with their hats.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Forster says of the natives of Mallicollo,
that “it is uncertain whether the scanty dress of their women
owes its origin to a sense of shame, or to an artful endeavour
to please;” and of the men of Tana, that “round their
middle they tie a string, and below that they employ the
leaves of a plant like ginger, for the same purpose and in the
same manner as the natives of Mallicollo. Boys, as soon as
they attain the age of six years, are provided with these
leaves; which seems to confirm what I have observed in regard
to the Mallicollese, <i>viz.</i>, that they do not employ this
covering from motives of decency. Indeed, it had so much
the contrary appearance, that in the person of every native of
Tana or Mallicollo, we thought we beheld a living representation
of that terrible divinity who protected the orchard and
gardens of the ancients.”<a id="FNanchor_1176_1176" href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> Speaking of the very simple
dress worn by the male Hottentot, Barrow says, “If the
real intent of it was the promotion of decency, it should seem
that he has widely missed his aim, as it is certainly one of the
most immodest objects, in such a situation as he places it,
that could have been contrived.”<a id="FNanchor_1177_1177" href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> Among the Khyoungtha,
there is a native tradition worth mentioning in this connection.
“A certain queen,” Captain Lewin tells us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> “noticed
with regret that the men of the nation were losing their love
for the society of the women, and were resorting to vile and
abominable practices, from which the worst possible results
might be expected. She therefore prevailed upon her husband
to promulgate a rigorous order, prescribing the form of
petticoat to be worn by all women in future, and directing
that the male should be tattooed, in order that, by thus
disfiguring the males, and adding <i>piquancy to the beauty of the
women</i>, the former might once more return to the feet of their
wives.”<a id="FNanchor_1178_1178" href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a></p>

<p>Moreover, we know that some tribes who go perfectly
naked are ashamed to cover themselves, looking upon a garment
as something indecent. The pious father Gumilla was
greatly astonished to find that the Indians on the Orinoco
did not blush at their nakedness. “Si les Missionnaires” he
says, “qui ignorent leurs coutumes s’avisent de distribuer des
mouchoirs, surtout aux femmes, pour qu’elles puissent se
couvrir, elles les jettent dans la rivière, où elles vont les
cacher, pour ne point être obligées de s’en servir; et lors
qu’on leur dit de se couvrir, elles répondent: ... ‘Nous ne
couvrons point, <i>parce que cela nous cause de la honte</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_1179_1179" href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> That
this is no “traveller’s tale” merely, appears from the following
statement made by v. Humboldt with reference to the New
Andalusian Chaymas, who, like most savage peoples dwelling
in regions excessively hot, have an insuperable aversion to
clothing:—“Under the torrid zone,” he asserts, “ ... the
natives are ashamed, as they say, to be clothed; and flee to
the woods when they are too soon compelled to give up their
nakedness.”<a id="FNanchor_1180_1180" href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> Again, in an Indian hut at Mucúra in Brazil,
Mr. Wallace found the women entirely without covering, and
apparently quite unconscious of the fact. One of them, however,
possessed a “saía,” or petticoat, which she sometimes put
on, and seemed then, as Mr. Wallace says, “almost as much
ashamed of herself as civilized people would be if they took
theirs off.”<a id="FNanchor_1181_1181" href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a></p>

<p>There are several instances of peoples who, although they
generally go perfectly naked, sometimes use a covering.
This they always do under circumstances which plainly indicate
that the covering is worn simply as a means of attraction.
Thus Lohmann tells us that, among the Saliras, only
harlots clothe themselves; and they do so in order to excite
through the unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1182_1182" href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> In many heathen tribes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
interior of Africa, according to Barth, the married women are
entirely nude, whilst the young marriageable girls cover
their nakedness,—a practice analogous to that of a married
woman being deprived of her ornaments and her hair.<a id="FNanchor_1183_1183" href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> Mr.
Mathews states that, in many parts of Australia, “the females,
and more especially young girls, wear a fringe suspended
from a belt round the waist.”<a id="FNanchor_1184_1184" href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a> Concerning the natives of
Botany Bay (New South Wales), Barrington remarks that
“the females at an early age wear a little apron, made from
the skin of the opossum or kangaroo, cut into slips, and
hanging a few inches from the waist; this they wear till they
grow up and are taken by men, and then they are left off.”<a id="FNanchor_1185_1185" href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a>
Collins says the same of the girls at Port Jackson;<a id="FNanchor_1186_1186" href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> Mr.
Palmer of some other Australians;<a id="FNanchor_1187_1187" href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> and Captain Snow of
all those tribes among whom he had been for several weeks.<a id="FNanchor_1188_1188" href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a>
Again, on Moreton Island, according to Macgillivray, both
men and women went about altogether unclothed, but the
female children wore a small fringe in front. The same
naturalist reports that, in almost all the tribes of Torris
Strait, the women wear a petticoat of fine shreds of pandanus
leaves, the ends worked into a waistband, upon the construction
of which much labour is expended; but it is only
“sometimes put on, especially by the young girls, and when
about to engage in dancing.” Under this, however, another
covering is usually worn.<a id="FNanchor_1189_1189" href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> Among the Tupi tribes of Brazil,
as soon as a girl became marriageable “cotton cords were
tied round her waist and round the fleshy part of both arms;
they denoted a state of maidenhood, and, if any one but a
maiden wore them, they were persuaded that the Anhanga
would fetch her away.... It cannot,” Mr. Southey adds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> “have
been invented for the purpose of keeping the women chaste
till marriage, for these bands were broken without fear, and
incontinence was not regarded as an offence.”<a id="FNanchor_1190_1190" href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a> Among the
Narrinyeri of Southern Australia, girls wear a sort of apron
of fringe until they bear their first child, and, if they have no
children, it is taken from them and burned by the husband
while they are asleep.<a id="FNanchor_1191_1191" href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> In the Koombokkaburra tribe also,
the young women wear in front an apron of spun opossum
fur, which is generally given up after the birth of the first
or second child.<a id="FNanchor_1192_1192" href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a></p>

<p>There are several cases in which only the married women
are clothed, the unmarried going entirely naked.<a id="FNanchor_1193_1193" href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> But such
instances do not conflict with the hypothesis suggested.
Through long-continued use covering loses its original character
and becomes a sign of modesty, whilst perfect nakedness
becomes a stimulus. Usually, where nudity is considered
indecent, the garments of the girls of barbarous peoples are
restricted as much as possible, whilst those of the older
women are comparatively seemly. Thus, among the African
Schulis, the married women wear a narrow fringe of string in
front, the unmarried wearing nothing but bead ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_1194_1194" href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a>
Among the natives of Tassai, New Guinea, the former use a
larger and thicker kind of petticoat of pandanus leaf, divided
into long grass-like shreds, reaching to the knee; while that
worn by the latter consists merely of single lengths made
fast to a string which ties round the waist.<a id="FNanchor_1195_1195" href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> In Fiji, the liku—a
kind of band made from hibiscus-bark—is before marriage
worn very short, but after the birth of the first child is
much lengthened;<a id="FNanchor_1196_1196" href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> and a similar practice occurs in other
islands of the South Sea.<a id="FNanchor_1197_1197" href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>The dances and festivals of many savage peoples are
notoriously accompanied by the most hideous licentiousness.
Then the young men and women endeavour to please each
other in various ways, painting themselves with brilliant
colours, and decorating themselves with all sorts of ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_1198_1198" href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a>
On such occasions many tribes who go naked in
everyday life put on a scanty covering. Mr. Bonwick states
that, among the Tasmanians, a fur string or band of emu
feathers was used by some tribes, but only on great festivities;
and the women wore in the dance a covering of leaves or
feathers, which, as among the Australians on similar occasions,
was removed directly afterwards. Tasmanian dances were
performed “with the avowed intention of exciting the passions
of the men, in whose presence one young woman had the
dance to herself.”<a id="FNanchor_1199_1199" href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a> Among the Australian Pegulloburras,
who generally go entirely naked, the women on festive occasions
wear round the middle small fringes.<a id="FNanchor_1200_1200" href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a> Speaking of
the Brazilian Uaupés, Mr. Wallace asserts that, “while dancing
in their festivals, the women wear a small ‘tanga,’ or apron,
made of beads, prettily arranged. It is only about six inches
square, but is never worn at any other time, and immediately
the dance is over, it is taken off.” Besides, their bodies are
painted.<a id="FNanchor_1201_1201" href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> The same was the case with the Tahitian Areois—a
sort of privileged libertines, leading a most licentious life,
and practising lewd dances and pantomimes,—who also sometimes,
on public occasions, put on a girdle of the yellow “ti”
leaves, which, in appearance, resembled the feather girdles of
the Peruvians or other South American tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1202_1202" href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a> As to the
South African Basutos, Mr. Casalis states that marriageable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
girls “frequently indulge in grotesque dances, and at those
times wear, as a sort of petticoat, long bands composed of a
series of rushes artistically strung together.”<a id="FNanchor_1203_1203" href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a></p>

<p>Very generally in the savage world, where climate does
not put obstacles in the way, both sexes go naked till they
reach manhood, covering being resorted to at the same period
of life as other ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_1204_1204" href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> A South Australian boy, for
instance, when fourteen or sixteen years old, has to undergo
the initiatory rites of manhood as follows:—he is smeared
all over with red ochre and grease, the hair is plucked from
his body, and all his friends gather green gum bushes, which
they place under his armpits and over the <i>os pubis</i>, after
which the boy is entitled to marry.<a id="FNanchor_1205_1205" href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a></p>

<p>In conformity with other ornaments, what we consider decent
covering is said to be more common with savage men than
with women. “If dress were the result of a feeling of shame,”
Professor Waitz observes, “we should expect it to be more indispensable
to woman than to man, which is not the case.”<a id="FNanchor_1206_1206" href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a> In
America, according to v. Humboldt—among the Caribs, for
instance—the men are often more decently clothed than the
women.<a id="FNanchor_1207_1207" href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a> The same is stated of the Nagas of Upper Assam;<a id="FNanchor_1208_1208" href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a>
and Barth, who had a vast experience of African savages, remarks,
“I have observed that many heathen tribes consider a
covering, however poor and scanty it may be, more necessary
for man than woman.”<a id="FNanchor_1209_1209" href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> Whether this is the rule among
savage peoples is doubtful. At any rate, the egoism of
the men cannot be blamed for the nakedness of the women.
For a savage Eve may pluck her clothes from the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>In support of the psychological presumption which underlies
the hypothesis here adduced, it may be added that some
peoples are in the habit of covering other parts of the body
also, in order to “excite through the unknown.” Thus,
among the Tipperahs, the married women wear nothing but a
short petticoat, while the unmarried girls cover the breast with
a gaily-dyed cloth with fringed ends.<a id="FNanchor_1210_1210" href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> Among the Toungtha,
the bosoms of women are left uncovered after the birth of the
first child, but the unmarried girls wear a narrow breast cloth.<a id="FNanchor_1211_1211" href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a>
The Chinese consider small feet to be the chief charm of their
women, and the girls have to undergo horrible torture while
their feet are being compressed to the smallest possible size.
It might be supposed that they would at least have the pleasure
of fascinating the men by a beauty so painfully acquired. But
Dr. Stricker assures us that, in China, a woman is considered
immodest if she shows her artificially distorted foot to a man.
It is even improper to speak of a woman’s foot, and in decent
pictures this part is always concealed under the dress.<a id="FNanchor_1212_1212" href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> The
women of Agades, according to Barth, generally go unveiled,
and if they sometimes cover their heads, this is done rather
from coquetry than from a feeling of shame.<a id="FNanchor_1213_1213" href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> Mr. Man remarks
that a Hindu woman who attempts to hide her face,
while she wears a gauze which displays her whole form, in her
simulated modesty always appears as if attempting to convey
an <i>arrière pensée</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1214_1214" href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> Among the Tacullies, it is customary
for the girls to have over their eyes a kind of veil or fringe,
made either of strung beads or of narrow strips of deer skin
garnished with porcupine quills;<a id="FNanchor_1215_1215" href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> and, among the Chawanons,
according to Moore, those young women who have any pretensions
to beauty, as soon as they become marriageable,
“muffle themselves up so that when they go abroad it is impossible
to see anything but their eyes. On these indications
of beauty they are eagerly sought in marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_1216_1216" href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that this covering, or half covering,
is only one of the means by which savage men and women endeavor
to direct attention to that which civilized man conceals
from a sense of shame. Among the Admiralty Islanders, the
only covering is a shell, which shell is often tastefully engraved
with the usual zigzag patterns, whilst its dazzling whiteness
forms a very striking contrast with the blackness of the skin.<a id="FNanchor_1217_1217" href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a>
On reaching puberty, the Tankhul Nagas assume, instead of
a shell, a horn or ivory ring from an eighth to a quarter of an
inch in breadth; being apparently of opinion that exposure, if
so attended, is not a matter to be ashamed of.<a id="FNanchor_1218_1218" href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a> Some of the
Brazilian Tupis, according to Castlenau, “mentulam inserunt
in annulum ligneum, unde appellantur Porrudos, <i>i.e.</i> mentulati;”<a id="FNanchor_1219_1219" href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a>
and, in several of the South Sea Islands, those parts of
the body which civilized people are most anxious to conceal, are
decorated with tattoos.<a id="FNanchor_1220_1220" href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a> De indigenis Tanembaris et Timorlaonis

<p>Above all the practice of circumcision should be noticed in
this connection, since, as I believe, it owes its origin to the
same cause. It is by no means a specifically Jewish custom,
but is widely spread over the earth. It is in use among all the
Mohammedan peoples, among most of the tribes inhabiting
the African West Coast, among the Kafirs, among nearly all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
the peoples of Eastern Africa, among the Christian Abyssinians,
Bogos, and Copts,<a id="FNanchor_1222_1222" href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> throughout all the various tribes
inhabiting Madagascar,<a id="FNanchor_1223_1223" href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> and, in the heart of the Black Continent,
among the Monbuttu and Akka. Moreover, it is
practised very commonly in Australia, in many islands
of Melanesia,<a id="FNanchor_1224_1224" href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> and in Polynesia universally. It has also
been met with in some parts of America: in Yucatan,<a id="FNanchor_1225_1225" href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> on the
Orinoco,<a id="FNanchor_1226_1226" href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> and among certain tribes in the Rio Branco in
Brazil.<a id="FNanchor_1227_1227" href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> The Jews, Mohammedans,<a id="FNanchor_1228_1228" href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> Abyssinians,<a id="FNanchor_1229_1229" href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> and some
other peoples being excepted, it is always performed when
the boy attains manhood—<i>i.e.</i>, at the same age as that at
which he is tattooed or painted, or begins to dress or adorn
himself. Indeed, through the operation of circumcision, the
boy becomes a man, and, where it is wanting, some other
operation or deformation of the body supplies its place.<a id="FNanchor_1230_1230" href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a>
Thus, in Australia, some tribes practise circumcision, others
knock out teeth, when the youth becomes virile.<a id="FNanchor_1231_1231" href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> Where
circumcision is in use it is generally considered an indispensable
preliminary to marriage, “uncircumcised” being a
bad word, and the women often refusing all intercourse with
such a man.<a id="FNanchor_1232_1232" href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a></p>

<p>Several different explanations of this custom have been
suggested.<a id="FNanchor_1233_1233" href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a> Some authors believe that it is due to hygienic
motives. But circumcised and uncircumcised peoples live
under the same conditions in the same neighbourhood side by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
side, without any difference in their physical condition.<a id="FNanchor_1234_1234" href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> Mr.
Sturt remarks that, in Australia, “you would meet with a
tribe with which that custom did not prevail, between two
with which it did.”<a id="FNanchor_1235_1235" href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> Moreover, as Mr. Spencer observes,
while the usage does not exist among the most cleanly races
in the world, it is common among the most uncleanly.<a id="FNanchor_1236_1236" href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a>
Among the Damaras and Bechuanas, the boys are circumcised,
though these peoples are described as exceedingly filthy in
their habits,<a id="FNanchor_1237_1237" href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a> and so also among the people of Madagascar
and the Malays, who are far from being so cleanly as might
be desired.<a id="FNanchor_1238_1238" href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a></p>

<p>Again, according to Mr. Spencer, circumcision involves an
offering to the gods. He suggests that in the first instance
vanquished enemies were mutilated in order that a specially
valuable trophy after a battle might be presented to the king
Then, “in a highly militant society governed by a divinely-descended
despot, ... we may expect that the presentation to
the king of these trophies taken from enslaved enemies, will
develop into the offering to the god of like trophies taken from
each generation of male citizens in acknowledgment of their
slavery to him.”<a id="FNanchor_1239_1239" href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a> This conclusion Mr. Spencer draws from
the single fact that, “among the Abyssinians, the trophy taken
by circumcision from an enemy’s dead body is presented by
each warrior to his chief.” But there is no evidence whatever
that this curious custom is of common occurrence. Circumcision
is spread over a very large part of the earth, and
prevails even in societies which are not “governed by a
divinely-descended despot,” who could require all his subjects
to bear this badge of servitude. With regard to the Australian
aborigines, many tribes of whom practise circumcision, Mr.
Curr says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> “On the subject of government (by which I mean
the habitual exercise of authority, by one or a few individuals,
over a community or a body of persons) I have made many
inquiries and received written replies from the observers
of about a hundred tribes to the effect that none exists.
Indeed, no fact connected with our tribes seems better
established.”<a id="FNanchor_1240_1240" href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> Since there is nothing to indicate that there
ever was a different state of things in Australia, how are we
to reconcile these facts with the interpretation offered by Mr.
Spencer?</p>

<p>In the Book of Genesis the practice of circumcision is
presented as a religious rite, deriving its origin from
a command of God. But among most peoples it appears
to have little, if any, religious significance.<a id="FNanchor_1241_1241" href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> Sometimes,
indeed, it is performed by a priest of the community, but, as
Herr Andree justly remarks, this has no necessary relation to
the question, the priests generally being the physicians of
savage tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1242_1242" href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> Moreover, as has already been pointed out,
almost every ancestral custom may by degrees take a religious
character. Thus, the ancient Peruvians’ habit of enlarging
the lobe of the ear, so as to enable it to carry ear-tubes of
great size, is supposed to have been connected with sun-worship;
for Spanish historians mention that elaborate
religious ceremonies were held at the Temple of the Sun at
Cuzco, on the occasion of the boring of the ears of young
Peruvian nobles.<a id="FNanchor_1243_1243" href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> But we should not be warranted in
inferring that this custom had originally anything to do
with religion. With regard to circumcision among the
Jews, I agree with Herr Andree that its religious character
was almost certainly of a comparatively late date.<a id="FNanchor_1244_1244" href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a></p>

<p>The peoples among whom this practice prevails are themselves
unable to give any adequate account of its origin. With
reference to the circumcision of the Southern Africans, the
Rev. H. H. Dugmore says that they do not know how it began
and that they have no traditionary remembrances about it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
except that it has prevailed as a national custom from generation
to generation. “Our forefathers did so, and therefore we
do the same,” is all that the present generation can say about
the matter.<a id="FNanchor_1245_1245" href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a></p>

<p>That the practice of circumcision arose from the same
desire as that which led to other kinds of mutilation, is
rendered more probable by the fact that disfiguration is
sometimes effected in quite a different way. Novae Zealandiae
incolas Cook narrat non solum se non circumcidere, sed
contra tam necessarium habere praeputium, ut anteriorem
eius partem redimire soleant ligamento, quo glandem penis
tegant.<a id="FNanchor_1246_1246" href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> The same curious usage is met with in some other
Islands of the South Sea;<a id="FNanchor_1247_1247" href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> and in Brazil, according to Dr. Karl
von den Steinen, among the Trumaí.<a id="FNanchor_1248_1248" href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> Indigenae Portus
Lincoln pueros pubertatem ingressos mirum in modum secant:
quarzi fragmento penem ex ore secundum inferiorem
partem usque ad scrotum incidunt itaque totum longitudinis
spatium detegunt.<a id="FNanchor_1249_1249" href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a> In defence of this practice, says Mr.
Schürmann, the natives had nothing to suggest except that
“it was observed by their forefathers, and must therefore be
upheld by themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_1250_1250" href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> In Ponapé, boys are always subjected
to semi-castration, as Dr. Finsch remarks, in order to prevent
the possibility of orchitis, and, further, because the girls consider
men thus disfigured handsomer and more attractive than
others. According to Captain Wright, the same custom prevails
in Niutabutabu, of the Tonga Islands.<a id="FNanchor_1251_1251" href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a></p>

<p>Among many peoples of Africa, and in certain tribes of the
Malay Archipelago and South America, the girls also undergo
a sort of circumcision, and this is looked upon as an in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>dispensable
preliminary to marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1252_1252" href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> Sunt autem gentes,
quarum contrarius mos est, ut clitoris et labia minora non exsecentur,
verum extendantur, et saepe longissime extendandur.
Atque ista etiam deformatio insigne pulchritudinis existimatur.<a id="FNanchor_1253_1253" href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a>
De indigenis Ponapéis haec adnotat Dr. Finsch; labia interna
longius extenta et pendentia puellis et uxoribus singulare
sunt incitamentum, quae res eodem modo se habet apud alias
gentes, ut apud Hottentottas.<a id="FNanchor_1254_1254" href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a></p>

<p>It certainly seems strange that such deformities should have
been originally intended to improve the appearance. But we
must remember the rough taste of savages, and the wish for
variety so deeply rooted in human nature. These practices
evidently began at a time when man went in a state of perfect
nudity. The mutilations, as the eyes became accustomed to
them, gradually ceased to be interesting, and continued to be
inflicted merely through the force of habit, or from a religious
motive. A new stimulus was then invented, parts of the
body which had formerly been exposed being hidden by a
scanty covering: as the Chinese women at first had their feet
pressed in order to excite admiration, but afterwards began
to conceal them from coquetry, or as the Tassai beauties,
though entirely naked otherwise, wear two or three petticoats
one over another.<a id="FNanchor_1255_1255" href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How, then, are we to explain the connection which undoubtedly
exists between nakedness and the feeling of shame?
The hypothesis here set forth cannot be regarded as fully
established until this question is answered.</p>

<p>“The ideas of modesty,” Forster truly says, “are different
in every country, and change in different periods of time.”<a id="FNanchor_1256_1256" href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a>
As v. Humboldt remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> “A woman in some parts of Asia is
not permitted to show the ends of her fingers; while an
Indian of the Caribbean race is far from considering herself
naked, when she wears a ‘guajuco’ two inches broad. Even
this band is regarded as a less essential part of dress than the
pigment which covers the skin. To go out of the hut without
being painted with arnotta, is to transgress all the rules of
Caribbean decency.”<a id="FNanchor_1257_1257" href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> In Tahiti, a person not properly
tattooed would “be as much reproached and shunned, as if
with us he should go about the streets naked;”<a id="FNanchor_1258_1258" href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a> and, in Tonga
also, the men would think it very indecent not to be tattooed.<a id="FNanchor_1259_1259" href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a></p>

<p>M. Letourneau reports that, at Basra on the Euphrates, it
was the duty of a woman, if surprised when taking her bath,
to turn her face; no further concealment was considered
necessary.<a id="FNanchor_1260_1260" href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a> The same habit prevailed among the fellah
women in Egypt;<a id="FNanchor_1261_1261" href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a> while, in Arabia, according to Ebers, a
woman acts even more indecorously in uncovering the back of
the head than in uncovering the face, though this also is carefully
hidden.<a id="FNanchor_1262_1262" href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a></p>

<p>The Tubori women in Central Africa wear only a narrow
strap, to which is attached a twig hanging down behind; but
they feel greatly ashamed if the twig happens to fall off.<a id="FNanchor_1263_1263" href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> A
Chinese woman, as previously stated, is not permitted by the
law of modesty to show her feet; and the Samoans considered
it most disgraceful to expose the navel.<a id="FNanchor_1264_1264" href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> The savage tribes
of Sumatra and Celebes have a like feeling about the exposure
of the knee, which is always carefully covered.<a id="FNanchor_1265_1265" href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> Speaking
of the horrible mouth adornment worn by the women of
Port des Français (Alaska), which makes the lower part of
the mouth jut out two or three inches, La Pérouse remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
“We sometimes prevailed on them to pull off this ornament,
to which they with difficulty agreed; they then testified the
same embarrassment, and made the same gestures, as a woman
in Europe who discovers her bosom.”<a id="FNanchor_1266_1266" href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> Et Polynesios, quamquam
eum tenent morem, nullam ut aliam corporis partem
nisi glandem penis tegant, hanc tamen nudare vehementer
pudet. Ita Lisiansky animadvertit indigenas Nukahivae, qui
praeputium peni abductum habent et extremam eius partem
lino constrictam, linum illud magni aestimare manifesto apparere.
“Accidit enim,” inquit, “ut frater regis, ubi navem
meam ascendit, linum amitteret, qua occasione mala quam
maxime angebatur. Qui cum constratum navis ingrederetur,
illa re commotus partem non redimitam manibus velavit.”<a id="FNanchor_1267_1267" href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a>
Dr. Mosely asserts that the Admiralty Islanders, who wear
nothing but a shell, always cover themselves hastily on
removing the shell for barter, and evidently consider that
they are exposing themselves either indecently or irreligiously,
if they show themselves perfectly nude.<a id="FNanchor_1268_1268" href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> The Kubus of
Sumatra have a tradition that they are descendants of the
youngest of three brothers, the first and second of whom were
circumcised in the usual way, while it was found that no
instruments would circumcise the third. This so <i>ashamed</i>
him that he betook himself to the woods.<a id="FNanchor_1269_1269" href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a></p>

<p>Ideas of modesty, therefore, are altogether relative and
conventional. Peoples who are accustomed to tattoo themselves
are ashamed to appear untattooed; peoples whose
women are in the habit of covering their faces consider such
a covering indispensable for every respectable woman; peoples
who for one reason or another have come to conceal the navel,
the knee, the bosom, or other parts, blush to reveal what is
hidden. It is not the feeling of shame that has provoked
the covering, but the covering that has provoked the feeling
of shame.</p>

<p>This feeling, Dr. Bain remarks, “is resolved by a reference
to the dread of being condemned, or ill-thought of, by others.”<a id="FNanchor_1270_1270" href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a>
Such dread is undoubtedly one of the most powerful motives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
of human action. Speaking of the Greenlanders, Cranz says
that the mainspring of all that they do is their fear of being
blamed or mocked by other men.<a id="FNanchor_1271_1271" href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a> Among savages, custom
is a tyrant as potent as law has ever been in civilized
societies, every deviation from a usage which has taken root
among the people being laughed to scorn, or regarded with
disdain. The young ladies of Balonda, wholly unconscious of
their own deficiency, could not maintain their gravity at the
sight of the naked backs of Livingstone’s men. “Much to
the annoyance of my companions,” he says, “the young
girls laughed outright whenever their backs were turned to
them, for the Balonda men wear a dress consisting of
skins of small animals, hanging before and behind from a
girdle round the loins.”<a id="FNanchor_1272_1272" href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> By degrees a custom is associated
with religion, and then becomes even more powerful than
before. Mr. Williams tells us of a Fijian priest, who, like all
his countrymen, was satisfied with a “masi,” or scanty hip-cloth,
but on hearing a description of the naked inhabitants
of New Caledonia and of their idols, exclaimed, contemptuously,
“Not have a ‘masi,’ and yet pretend to have gods!”<a id="FNanchor_1273_1273" href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a>
And, as Peschel remarks, “were a pious Mussulman of Ferghana
to be present at our balls, and see the bare shoulders of
our wives and daughters, and the semi-embraces of our round
dances, he would silently wonder at the long-suffering of
Allah, who had not long ago poured fire and brimstone on
this sinful and shameless generation.”<a id="FNanchor_1274_1274" href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a></p>

<p>Covering the nakedness has, for the reason already pointed
out, become a very common practice among savage peoples;
among those of the tropics, no other sort of clothing is
generally in use. Hence, through the power of custom, the
feeling of shame aroused by the exposure of the nakedness.
If this is the true explanation, some may be disposed to infer
that savages who, for the sake of cold, cover almost the entire
body, will feel ashamed to bare even such parts as may elsewhere
be shown without compunction. But this would be to
overlook the essential fact that the heat of their dwellings, where
they spend most of the winter, and the warmth of the summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
sun, in many cases make it necessary for them, as they think,
to throw off all their clothes. When this is done, they seem to
be devoid of any sense of shame. Thus, the Aleuts undress
themselves completely in their warm jurts, and men and
women have for ages been accustomed to bathe together in
the sea; “they do not think of there being any immodesty in
it, yet, any immorality is exceedingly rare among them.”<a id="FNanchor_1275_1275" href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a>
The Tacullies, who usually take off their clothes in summer,
though they are well clad in winter, manifest, according to
Harmon, as little sense of shame in regard to uncovering “as
the very brute creation.”<a id="FNanchor_1276_1276" href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> The Eskimo of Etah, who in the
winter are enveloped to the face in furs, nevertheless,
according to Kane’s description, completely put aside their
garments in their subterranean dwellings;<a id="FNanchor_1277_1277" href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> and the demeanour
of the wife of Hans the Eskimo on board Hayes’s ship,
plainly showed that she had no idea of decency.<a id="FNanchor_1278_1278" href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, we know that peoples living in warm
climates who cover only the nakedness are utterly ashamed to
expose it. The Andamanese, although they wear as little
clothing as possible, exhibit a delicacy that amounts to
prudishness, the women of the tribes of South Andaman being
so modest that they will not remove their small apron of
leaves, or put anything in its place, in the presence of any
person, even of their own sex.<a id="FNanchor_1279_1279" href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> Speaking of the Fijians,
Wilkes asserts that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> “though almost naked, these natives have
a great idea of modesty, and consider it extremely indelicate
to expose the whole person. If either a man or woman
should be discovered without the ‘maro,’ or ‘liku,’ they would
probably be killed.”<a id="FNanchor_1280_1280" href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> The female natives of Nukahiva have
only one small covering, but are so tenacious of it that the
most licentious will not consent to take it off.<a id="FNanchor_1281_1281" href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> Among those
Australian tribes, in which a covering is worn by the women,
they will retire out of sight to bathe.<a id="FNanchor_1282_1282" href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> In Lukunor and
Radack, men and women never appear naked together;<a id="FNanchor_1283_1283" href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> and
among the Pelew Islanders, according to Semper, the women
have an unlimited privilege of striking, fining, or, if it be done
on the spot, killing any man who makes his way in to their
bathing-places.<a id="FNanchor_1284_1284" href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a></p>

<p>These facts appear to prove that the feeling of shame, far
from being the original cause of man’s covering his body,
is, on the contrary, a result of this custom; and that the
covering, if not used as a protection from the climate, owes
its origin, at least in a great many cases, to the desire of men
and women to make themselves mutually attractive.<a id="FNanchor_1285_1285" href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> To
some readers it may perhaps seem probable that the covering
of the nakedness was originally due to the feeling which
makes intimate relations between the sexes, even among
savages, a more or less secret matter. But, whilst this feeling
is universal in mankind, there are, as we have seen, a great
many peoples who attach no idea of shame to the entire exposure
of the body, and these peoples are otherwise not less
modest than those who cover themselves. Their number is,
indeed, so great that we cannot regard the absence of shame
as a reversion or perversion; and it may be asserted with
perfect confidence that the modesty which shows itself in
covering is not an instinct in the same sense as that in which
the aversion to incest, for example, is an instinct,—an aversion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
to which sexual bashfulness seems to be very closely related.
Travellers have observed that, among various naked tribes,
women exhibit a strong sense of modesty through various
attitudes. But these attitudes may, like concealment by
clothing, have been <i>originally</i> due to coquetry. They imply
a vivid consciousness of certain facts, and the exhibition of
this consciousness is far from being a mark of modesty. It
may, further, be supposed that decent covering was adopted
for the protection of parts specially liable to injury. This
may hold good for some cases; but the general prevalence of
circumcision even among naked tribes shows that savages are
not particularly anxious about the safety of their persons.</p>

<small>THE LIBERTY OF CHOICE.</small></h2>


<p>It would be easy to adduce numerous instances of savage
and barbarous tribes among whom a girl is far from having
the entire disposal of her own hand. Being regarded as an
object of property, she is treated accordingly.</p>

<p>Among many peoples the female children are usually
“engaged” in their earliest youth. Concerning the Eskimo
to the north of Churchill, Franklin states that, “as soon as a
girl is born, the young lad who wishes to have her for a wife
goes to her father’s tent and proffers himself. If accepted, a
promise is given which is considered binding, and the girl is
delivered to her betrothed at the proper age.”<a id="FNanchor_1286_1286" href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> Early
betrothals are among the established customs of the Chippewyans,<a id="FNanchor_1287_1287" href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a>

American peoples.<a id="FNanchor_1291_1291" href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> Among the African Marutse, the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
“are often affianced at an early age, and the marriage
is consummated as soon as the girl arrives at maturity.”<a id="FNanchor_1292_1292" href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a>
The Negroes of the Gold Coast, according to Bosman, often
arranged for the marriage of infants directly after birth;<a id="FNanchor_1293_1293" href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a>
whilst, among the Bushmans, Bechuanas, and Ashantees,
children are engaged when they are still in the womb, in the
event of their proving to be girls.<a id="FNanchor_1294_1294" href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a></p>

<p>In Australia, too, girls are frequently promised in early
youth, and sometimes before they are born.<a id="FNanchor_1295_1295" href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> The same is the
case in New Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_1296_1296" href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a> New Zealand,<a id="FNanchor_1297_1297" href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> Tahiti,<a id="FNanchor_1298_1298" href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> and many other

inhabiting the Malay Archipelago.<a id="FNanchor_1299_1299" href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> Mariner supposed that,
in Tonga, about one-third of the married women had been
thus betrothed.<a id="FNanchor_1300_1300" href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> In British India infant-marriage has hitherto
been a common custom; and all peoples of the Turkish stock,
according to Professor Vámbéry, are in the habit of betrothing
babies.<a id="FNanchor_1301_1301" href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> So also are the Samoyedes<a id="FNanchor_1302_1302" href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> and Tuski;<a id="FNanchor_1303_1303" href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> and
among the Jews of Western Russia, parents betroth the
children whom they hope to have.<a id="FNanchor_1304_1304" href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a></p>

<p>Among some peoples, it is the mother,<a id="FNanchor_1305_1305" href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> brother,<a id="FNanchor_1306_1306" href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> or ma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>ternal
uncle,<a id="FNanchor_1307_1307" href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> who has the chief power of giving a girl in
marriage. In Timor-laut, Mr. Forbes says, “nothing can be
done of such import as the disposal of a daughter without the
advice, assistance, and witness of all the villagers, women and
youths being admitted as freely to speak as the elder males;”<a id="FNanchor_1308_1308" href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a>
and in West Australia, according to Mr. Oldfield, the consent
of the whole tribe is necessary for a girl’s marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1309_1309" href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> Yet
such cases are no doubt rare exceptions, and give us no right
to conclude that there ever was a time when children were
generally considered the property of the tribe, or of their
maternal kinsfolk.</p>

<p>It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that, among the
lower races, women are, as a rule, married without having
any voice of their own in the matter. Their liberty of
selection, on the contrary, is very considerable, and, however
down-trodden, they well know how to make their influence
felt. Thus, among the Indians of North America, numberless
instances are given of woman’s liberty to choose her husband.
Schoolcraft asserts that their marriages are brought about
“sometimes with, and sometimes against, the wishes of the
graver and more prudent relatives of the parties,” the marital
rite consisting chiefly in the consent of the parties.<a id="FNanchor_1310_1310" href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> Heckewelder
quotes instances of Indians who committed suicide
because they had been disappointed in love, the girls on
whom they had fixed their choice, and to whom they were
engaged, having changed their minds, and married other
lovers.<a id="FNanchor_1311_1311" href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> Among the Kaniagmuts, Thlinkets, and Nutkas,
the suitor has to consult the wishes of the young lady.<a id="FNanchor_1312_1312" href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a>
Among the Chippewas, according to Mr. Keating, the
mothers generally settle the preliminaries to marriage without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
consulting the children: but the parties are not considered
husband and wife till they have given their consent.<a id="FNanchor_1313_1313" href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> The
Atkha Aleuts occasionally betrothed their children to each
other, but the marriage was held to be binding only after the
birth of a child.<a id="FNanchor_1314_1314" href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a> Among the Creeks, if a man desires to
make a woman his wife “conformably to the more ancient
and serious custom of the country,” he endeavours to gain
her own consent by regular courtship.<a id="FNanchor_1315_1315" href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> Among the Pueblos,<a id="FNanchor_1316_1316" href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a>
&amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_1317_1317" href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a> “no girl is forced to marry against her will, however
eligible her parents may consider the match.”</p>

<p>As to the South American Guanas, Azara states, “Aucune
femme ne consent à se marier, sans avoir fait ses stipulations
préliminaires très-détaillées avec son prétendu, et avec son
père et ses parents, à l’égard de leur genre de vie réciproque.”<a id="FNanchor_1318_1318" href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a>
In Tierra del Fuego, according to Lieutenant Bove, the
eagerness with which the women seek for young husbands is
surprising, but even more surprising is the fact that they
nearly always attain their ends.<a id="FNanchor_1319_1319" href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> Speaking of the same
people, Mr. Bridges says, “It frequently happens that there
is insuperable aversion on the girl’s part to her husband, and
she leaves him, and if she persists in hating him she is then
given to one she likes.”<a id="FNanchor_1320_1320" href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> It is, indeed, common in America
for a girl to run away from a bridegroom forced upon her by
the parents;<a id="FNanchor_1321_1321" href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> whilst, if they refuse to give their daughter to
a suitor whom she loves, the couple elope.<a id="FNanchor_1322_1322" href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> Thus, among
the Dacotahs, as we are told by Mr. Prescott, “there are
many matches made by elopement, much to the chagrin of
the parents.”<a id="FNanchor_1323_1323" href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>In Australia it is the rule that a father alone can give
away his daughter, and, according to Mr. Curr, the woman
herself has no voice in the selection of her husband.<a id="FNanchor_1324_1324" href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> But,
with reference to the Narrinyeri, Mr. Taplin states that,
“although the consent of a female is not considered a matter
of the first importance, as, indeed, is the case in many uncivilized
nations, yet it is always regarded as desirable.”<a id="FNanchor_1325_1325" href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a>
Among the Kurnai, according to Mr. Howitt, she decidedly
enjoys the freedom of choice. Should the parents refuse their
consent, she goes away with her lover, and if they can remain
away till the girl is with child she may, it is said, expect to
be forgiven. Otherwise it may become necessary for them to
elope two or three times before they are pardoned, the family
at length becoming tired of objecting.<a id="FNanchor_1326_1326" href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> Mr. Mathew asserts
that, with varying details, marriage by mutual consent will
be found among other tribes also, though it is not completed
except by means of a run-away match.<a id="FNanchor_1327_1327" href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> Elopement undertaken
with the consent of the woman is, indeed, and has
been, a recognized institution among at least some of the
aboriginal tribes in Australia. Among the Kurnai it is the
rule.<a id="FNanchor_1328_1328" href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a></p>

<p>The Maoris have a proverb, “As a kahawai (a fish which
is very particular in selecting the hook that most resembles
its food) selects the hook which pleases it best out of a great
number, so also a woman chooses one man out of many.”<a id="FNanchor_1329_1329" href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a>
Mariner supposed that, in Tonga, perhaps two-thirds of the
girls had married with their own free consent.<a id="FNanchor_1330_1330" href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a> Concerning
the natives of Arorae, Mr. Turner says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> “In choosing a
husband the lady sat in the lower room of the house, and
over her head were let down through the chinks of the floor
of the upper room two or three cocoa-nut leaflets, the ends
of which were held by her lovers. She pulled at one, and
asked whose it was. If the reply was not in the voice of
the young man she wished to have, she left it and pulled at
another leaf, and another, until she found him, and then
pulled it right down. The happy man whose leaf she pulled
down sat still, while the others slunk away.”<a id="FNanchor_1331_1331" href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a> In the Society
Islands, the women of the middle and lower ranks had the
power to choose husbands according to their own wishes;
and that the women of the highest classes sometimes asserted
the same right appears from the addresses a chief of Eimeo
had to pay to the object of his attachment before she could
be induced to accept his offer.<a id="FNanchor_1332_1332" href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a> In Radack, “marriages
depend on a free convention,” as seems to be generally the
case in Micronesia.<a id="FNanchor_1333_1333" href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> In the New Britain Group, according to
Mr. Romilly, after the man has worked for years to pay for
his wife, and is finally in a position to take her to his house,
she may refuse to go, and he cannot claim back from the
parents the large sums he has paid them in yams, cocoa-nuts,
and sugar-canes.<a id="FNanchor_1334_1334" href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> With reference to the New Caledonian
girl, M. Moncelon remarks, “Elle est consultée quelquefois,
mais souvent est forcée d’obéir. Alors elle fuit à chaque
instant pour rejoindre l’homme qu’elle préfère.”<a id="FNanchor_1335_1335" href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a></p>

<p>In the Indian Archipelago, according to Professor Wilken,
most marriages are contracted by the mutual consent of the
parties.<a id="FNanchor_1336_1336" href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a> Among the Dyaks, “the unmarried girls are at
perfect liberty to choose their mates.”<a id="FNanchor_1337_1337" href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> In some parts of Java,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
much deference is paid to the bride’s inclinations;<a id="FNanchor_1338_1338" href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a> and,
among the Minahassers of Celebes, courtship or love-making
“is always strictly an affair of the heart and not in
any way dependent upon the consent or even wish of the
parents.”<a id="FNanchor_1339_1339" href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> Similar statements are made by Riedel with
reference to several of the smaller islands.<a id="FNanchor_1340_1340" href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a> Among the
Rejangs of Sumatra, if a young man runs away with a virgin
without the consent of her father, he does not act contrary to
the laws of the country; and, if he is willing to make the usual
payments afterwards, the woman cannot be reclaimed by her
father or other kinsfolk.<a id="FNanchor_1341_1341" href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a></p>

<p>In Burma, “the choice of marriageable girls is perfectly
free,” and marriages are occasionally contracted even in direct
opposition to the parents.<a id="FNanchor_1342_1342" href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a> Among the Shans, mutual consent
is required to constitute a valid union;<a id="FNanchor_1343_1343" href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> and, regarding
the Chittagong Hill tribes, Captain Lewin says that the
women’s “power of selecting their own husband is to the full
as free as that enjoyed by our own English maidens.”<a id="FNanchor_1344_1344" href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a> The
same is the case with many, perhaps most, of the uncivilized
tribes of India. The young couple often settle the affair
entirely between themselves, even though marriages are
ostensibly arranged by the parents;<a id="FNanchor_1345_1345" href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> or the parents, before
they give their children in marriage, consult them, and, as a
rule, follow their likings.<a id="FNanchor_1346_1346" href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> In case of parental objection,
elopements frequently take place.<a id="FNanchor_1347_1347" href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> Among the Kukis, a girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
who runs away from a husband she does not like is not
thought to act wrongly in doing so.<a id="FNanchor_1348_1348" href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> Among the aboriginal
tribes of China,<a id="FNanchor_1349_1349" href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a> the Ainos,<a id="FNanchor_1350_1350" href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a> Khamchadales,<a id="FNanchor_1351_1351" href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> Jakuts,<a id="FNanchor_1352_1352" href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> Ossetes,<a id="FNanchor_1353_1353" href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a>
&amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_1354_1354" href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a> the daughter’s inclinations are nearly always consulted.
And, in Corea, mutual choice was the ancient custom of the
country.<a id="FNanchor_1355_1355" href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a></p>

<p>Turning to Africa we find that, among the Touaregs, a girl
may select out of her suitors the one whom she herself
prefers.<a id="FNanchor_1356_1356" href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a> As to the West African negroes, Mr. Reade informed
Mr. Darwin that “the women, at least among the
more intelligent Pagan tribes, have no difficulty in getting
the husbands whom they may desire, although it is considered
unwomanly to ask a man to marry them.”<a id="FNanchor_1357_1357" href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> The accuracy of
this statement is confirmed by several travellers,<a id="FNanchor_1358_1358" href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> and it seems
to hold good for other parts of Africa. Among the Shulis,
according to Dr. Felkin, the women have a voice in the selection
of their husbands.<a id="FNanchor_1359_1359" href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a> The Mádi girls, says Emin Pasha,
enjoy great freedom, and are able to choose companions to
their liking.<a id="FNanchor_1360_1360" href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> Among the Marutse, “free women who have
not been given away or sold as slaves are allowed to choose
what husbands they please.”<a id="FNanchor_1361_1361" href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> The young Kafirs endeavour
generally at first to gain the consent of the girls, for it is,
as Mr. Leslie remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> “a mistake to imagine that a girl is
sold by her father in the same manner, and with the same
authority, with which he would dispose of a cow.”<a id="FNanchor_1362_1362" href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> And,
among the Hottentots<a id="FNanchor_1363_1363" href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a> and Bushmans,<a id="FNanchor_1364_1364" href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> when a girl has grown
up to womanhood without having previously been betrothed,
her lover must gain her approbation, as well as that of the
parents.</p>

<p>In works by ancient writers we find statements of the same
kind. Among the Cathæi, according to Strabo, the girls
chose their husbands, and the young men their wives;<a id="FNanchor_1365_1365" href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a> and
the same is said by Herodotus of the women of Lydia.<a id="FNanchor_1366_1366" href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> In
Indian and old Scandinavian tales virgins are represented
as having the power to dispose of themselves freely.<a id="FNanchor_1367_1367" href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> Thus
it was agreed that Skade should choose for herself a husband
among the Asas, but she was to make her choice by the feet,
the only part of their persons she was allowed to see.<a id="FNanchor_1368_1368" href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a></p>

<p>In view of such facts it is impossible to agree with M.
Letourneau that, during a very long period, woman was
married without her wishes being at all consulted.<a id="FNanchor_1369_1369" href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> There
can be no doubt that, under more primitive conditions, she was
even more free in that respect than she is now among most of
the lower races. At present a daughter is very commonly
an object of trade, and the more exclusively she is regarded
from this point of view, the less, of course, are her own likings
taken into account. Among the Bedouins of Mount Sinai,
who have marriage by purpose, no father thinks it necessary
to consult his daughter before selling her, whereas, among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Arabs of the eastern plain, the Aenezes, &amp;c., according to
Burckhardt, “the father never receives the price of the girl,
and therefore some regard is paid to her inclinations.”<a id="FNanchor_1370_1370" href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> But
it will be shown that marriage by purchase forms a comparatively
late stage in the history of the family relations of
mankind, owing its origin to the fact that daughters are
valuable as labourers, and therefore not given away for
nothing. Speaking of the Gippsland natives, Mr. Fison
says, “The assertion that women ‘eat and do not hunt’
cannot apply to the lower savages. On the contrary, whether
among the ruder agricultural tribes or those who are dependent
on supplies gathered from the ‘forest and the flood,’ the
women are food-providers, who supply to the full as much as
they consume, and render valuable service into the bargain.
In times of peace, as a general rule, they are the hardest
workers and the most useful members of the community.”<a id="FNanchor_1371_1371" href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a>
Now, the Australians, although a very rude race, have advanced
far beyond the original state of man. There is no
reason to doubt that, among our earliest human ancestors,
the possession of a woman was desired only for the gratification
of the man’s passions. It may be said generally that
in a state of nature every grown-up individual earns his
own living. Hence there is no slavery, as there is, properly
speaking, no labour. A man in the earliest times had no
reason, then, to retain his full-grown daughter; she might
go away, and marry at her pleasure. That she was not
necessarily gained by the very first male, we may conclude
from what we know about the lower animals. As Mr. Darwin
remarks, the female generally, or at least often, exerts some
choice. She can in most cases escape, if wooed by a male
who does not please her, and when pursued, as commonly
occurs, by several males, she seems often to have the opportunity,
whilst they are fighting with one another, of going
away with, or at least of temporarily paring with, some
one male.<a id="FNanchor_1372_1372" href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>It might be supposed that at a later stage, when family
ties grew stronger, and bride-stealing became a common way
of concluding a marriage, the consent of the woman in the event
of capture would be quite out of the question. Certainly it
must generally have been so when she fell as a booty into the
hands of an enemy. But women thus captured may in many
cases have been able to escape from the husbands forced on
them, and to return to their own, or some friendly neighbouring,
tribe. Very frequently, however, bride-stealing seems to
have taken place with the approval of the girl, there being no
other way in which the match could be concluded if her
parents were not willing to agree to it. It is a common mistake,
as Mr. Howitt remarks, to confound marriage by capture
and marriage by elopement. They are essentially different,
the one being effected without, the other with, the woman’s
consent.<a id="FNanchor_1373_1373" href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a> Thus, among the Australians, many, perhaps most,
cases of so-called bride-stealing come under the head of
elopements.<a id="FNanchor_1374_1374" href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a></p>

<p>Something remains to be said as to the position of sons
among uncivilized peoples. When young they are everywhere
as much dependent on the parents, or at least on the
father, as are their sisters. A boy may be sold, bartered
away, or even killed, if his father thinks proper. That the
power of life and death, under certain circumstances, rests
with the tribe is a matter of little importance in this connection.
But as soon as the young man grows up, the father,
as a rule, has no longer any authority over him, whereas a
woman is always more or less in a state of dependence,
marriage implying for her a change of owner only. Among
the Australians, says Mr. Curr, “sons become independent
when they have gone through the ceremonies by which they
attain to the <i>status</i> of manhood.”<a id="FNanchor_1375_1375" href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a> The full-grown man is
his own master; he is strong enough not to be kept in check
by his father, and, being able to shift for himself, he may
marry quite independently of the old man’s will.</p>

<p>It often happens, indeed, as we have seen, that parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
betroth their children when they are young.<a id="FNanchor_1376_1376" href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a> But, if such
an engagement is not always binding even for the woman, it
is of course all the less so for the man. “The choice among
the Kalmucks,” Liadov says, “belongs entirely to the parents.
Still, there is no constraint upon this point, and, if the son
declares that the selection of his parents displease him, there
is no further question about the matter.”<a id="FNanchor_1377_1377" href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a></p>

<p>Moreover, marriage contracts are concluded among certain
peoples by the parents of the parties, even when these are
full-grown.<a id="FNanchor_1378_1378" href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a> Among the Iroquois, according to Mr. Morgan,
the mother, when she considered her son of a suitable age for
marriage, looked about for a maiden whom she thought likely
to accord with him in disposition and temperament, and remonstrance
or objection on the part of the children was never
attempted.<a id="FNanchor_1379_1379" href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> Among the Basutos, the choice of “the great
wife” is generally made by the father.<a id="FNanchor_1380_1380" href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> And, in many of the
uncivilized tribes of India, parents are in the habit of betrothing
their sons.<a id="FNanchor_1381_1381" href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a> In certain cases, the parents merely go
through a form of selection, the matter having already been
really settled by the parties concerned;<a id="FNanchor_1382_1382" href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> and usually a man
who has been induced to marry a woman he does not like,
may divorce her and choose another according to his taste.
Yet, speaking of the Kisáns, Colonel Dalton says that “there
is no instance on record of a youth or maiden objecting to
the arrangement made for them.”<a id="FNanchor_1383_1383" href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a> The paternal authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
among these tribes of India implies, indeed, a family system
of higher type than we are accustomed to find among wild
races: it approaches the <i>patria potestas</i> of the ancient Aryan
nations. Thus, among the Kandhs, in each family the absolute
authority rests with the house-father; the sons have no
property during the father’s lifetime, and all the male children,
with their wives and descendants, continue to share the
father’s meal, prepared by the common mother.<a id="FNanchor_1384_1384" href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a> The father
chooses a full-grown woman as a wife for his young son.
“In the superior age of the bride,” says Colonel Macpherson,
“is seen a proof of the supremacy of the paternal authority
amongst this singular people. The parents obtain the wives
of their sons during their boyhood, as very valuable domestic
servants, and their selections are avowedly made with a view
to utility in this character.”<a id="FNanchor_1385_1385" href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a></p>

<p>Among savages the father’s power depends exclusively, or
chiefly, upon his superior strength. At a later stage, in connection
with a more highly developed system of ancestor-worship,
it becomes more ideal, and, at the same time, more
extensive and more absolute. Obedience to the father is
regarded as a sacred duty, the transgression of which will be
punished as a crime against the gods. Indeed, so prevalent
has this strengthened authority of the father been among
peoples who have reached a relatively high degree of civilization,
that it must be regarded as marking a stage in all
human history.</p>

<p>The family system of the savage Indians differs widely, in
this respect, from that which was established among the
ancient inhabitants of Mexico and Peru. Concerning the
Mexicans, Clavigero says that “their children were bred to
stand so much in awe of their parents, that, even when grown
up and married they hardly durst speak before them.”<a id="FNanchor_1386_1386" href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a> The
following was an exhortation of a Mexican to his son:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>—“Honour
all persons, particularly thy parents, to whom thou
owest obedience, respect, and service. Guard against imitating
the example of those wicked sons, who, like brutes that
are deprived of reason, neither reverence their parents, listen
to their instruction, nor submit to their correction; because
whoever follows their steps will have an unhappy end, will die
in a desperate or sudden manner, or will be killed and devoured
by wild beasts.”<a id="FNanchor_1387_1387" href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a> A youth was seldom allowed to
choose a wife for himself; he was expected to abide by the
selection of his parents. Hence it rarely happened that
a marriage took place without the sanction of parents or
other kinsfolk, and he who presumed to marry without such
sanction had to undergo penance, being looked upon as ungrateful,
ill-bred, and apostate.<a id="FNanchor_1388_1388" href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a> The belief was, according
to Torquemada, that an act of that kind would be punished
by some misfortune.<a id="FNanchor_1389_1389" href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> In a province of the Mexican empire,
it was even required that a bridegroom should be carried,
that he might be supposed to marry against his inclinations.<a id="FNanchor_1390_1390" href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a>
Touching the Guatemalans, Mr. Bancroft says, “It seems incredible
that the young men should have quietly submitted
to having their wives picked out for them without being
allowed any voice or choice in the matter. Yet we are told
that so great was their obedience and submission to their
parents that there never was any scandal in these things.”<a id="FNanchor_1391_1391" href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a>
In the greater part of Nicaragua, matches were arranged by
the parents; though there were certain independent towns in
which the girls chose their husbands from among the young
men, while the latter sat at a feast.<a id="FNanchor_1392_1392" href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> Again, in Peru, Inca
Pachacutec confirmed the law that sons should obey and
serve their fathers until they reached the age of twenty-five,
and that none should marry without the consent of the
parents, and of the parents of the girl, a marriage without
this consent being invalid and the children illegitimate.<a id="FNanchor_1393_1393" href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a></p>

<p>Similar ideas formerly prevailed, and to some extent are
still found, among the civilized nations of the Old World.
The Chinese have a maxim that, as the Emperor should have
a father’s love for his people, so a father should have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
sovereign’s power over his family.<a id="FNanchor_1394_1394" href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> From earliest youth the
Chinese lad is imbued with such respect for his parents that
it becomes at last a religious sentiment, and forms, as he gets
older, the basis of his only creed—the worship of ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_1395_1395" href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a>
Disobedience to parents is looked upon as a sin to be punished
with death, whether the offender be an infant or a full-grown
son or daughter. And in everything referring to the marriage
of the children parents are omnipotent. “From all antiquity
in China,” Navarette says, “no son ever did, or hereafter will,
marry without the consent of his parents.”<a id="FNanchor_1396_1396" href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> Indeed, according
to Mr. Medhurst, it is a universally acknowledged principle in
China that no person, of whatever age, can act for himself in
matrimonial matters during the lifetime or in the neighbourhood
of his parents or near senior kinsfolk. The power of
these guardians is so great that they may contract a marriage
for a junior who is absent from home, and he is bound to abide
by such engagement even though already affianced elsewhere
without their privity or consent.<a id="FNanchor_1397_1397" href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> The consequence of this
system is that, in many cases, the betrothed couple scarcely
know each other before marriage, the wedding being the first
occasion on which the man catches a glimpse of his wife’s
face.<a id="FNanchor_1398_1398" href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> In some parts of the Empire children are affianced in
infancy.<a id="FNanchor_1399_1399" href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a></p>

<p>In Japan, according to Professor Rein, a house-father enjoyed
the same extensive rights as the Roman <i>paterfamilias</i>—an
unlimited power over the person and property of his children.<a id="FNanchor_1400_1400" href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a>
Filial piety is considered the highest duty of man, and
not even death or the marriage relation weakens, to any great
extent, the hold of a father on a child. “With affection on
the one hand, and cunning on the other,” says Mr. Griffis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> “an
unscrupulous father may do what he will.... The Japanese
maiden, as pure as the purest Christian virgin, will, at the
command of her father, enter the brothel to-morrow, and
prostitute herself for life. Not a murmur escapes her
lips as she thus filially obeys.”<a id="FNanchor_1401_1401" href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a> Marriages are almost
invariably arranged by the parents or nearest kinsfolk of
the parties, or by the parties themselves with the aid of
an agent or middleman known as the “nakōdo,” it being
considered highly improper for them to arrange it on
their own account. Among the lower classes, such direct
unions are not unfrequent; but they are held in contempt, and
are known as “yagō,” <i>i.e.</i>, “meeting on a moor,”—a term of
disrespect showing the low opinion entertained of them. The
middleman’s duty consists in acquainting each of the parties
with the nature, habits, good and bad qualities, and bodily
infirmities of the other, and in doing his utmost to bring the
affair to a successful conclusion. It seldom happens that the
parties immediately interested communicate directly with the
middleman; if they have parents or guardians, it is done by
these, and, if not, by the nearest relation. The middleman has
to arrange for a meeting between the parties, which meeting
is known as the “mi ai,” literally “see meeting” and, if either
party is dissatisfied with the other after this introduction, the
matter proceeds no further. But, formerly, says Mr. Küchler,
“this ante-nuptial meeting was dispensed with in the case
of people of very exalted rank, who consequently never saw
each other until the bride removed her veil on the marriage
day.”<a id="FNanchor_1402_1402" href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient Arabs<a id="FNanchor_1403_1403" href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> and Hebrews, fathers exercised
very great rights over their families. According to the old
law of Jahveism, a father might sell his child to relieve his
own distress, or offer it to a creditor as a pledge.<a id="FNanchor_1404_1404" href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a> Death was
the penalty for a child who struck a parent, or even cursed
one;<a id="FNanchor_1405_1405" href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> though the father himself could not inflict this penalty
on his children, but had to appeal to the whole community.<a id="FNanchor_1406_1406" href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a>
How important were the duties of the child to the parents, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
shown in the primitive typical relation of Isaac to Abraham,
and may, as Ewald remarks, be at once learned from the
placing of the law on the subject among the Ten Commandments,
and from its position there in immediate proximity
to the commands relating to the duties of man towards God.<a id="FNanchor_1407_1407" href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a>
According to Michaelis, there is nowhere the slightest trace of
its having been the will of Moses that paternal authority and
the subjection of sons should cease after a certain age.<a id="FNanchor_1408_1408" href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> A
Hebrew father not only disposed of his daughter’s hand, but
chose wives for his sons,—the selection, however, being sometimes
made by the mother.<a id="FNanchor_1409_1409" href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a></p>

<p>Judging from the marked severity of filial duties among the
Egyptians, some of which are distinctly alluded to in the
inscription of Thebes, we may conclude that, in Egypt, much
more was expected from a son than in any European nation
of the present day.<a id="FNanchor_1410_1410" href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a> And in the ‘Precepts of Ptah-Hotep,’
which have been called “the most ancient book in the world,”
we read that the father ought to command, the son to obey:—“The
son who accepts the word of his father will attain old
age on that account. God wishes us to obey; disobedience is
abhorrent to Him.”<a id="FNanchor_1411_1411" href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a></p>

<p>Among the Romans, the house-father had, in the earlier
time, the <i>jus vitae necisque</i>—the power of life and death—over
his children. He could imprison, sell, or kill his children
under an express law of the Twelve Tables;<a id="FNanchor_1412_1412" href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a> and Plutarch
says Brutus condemned his sons to death, without judicial
forms, not as consul, but as father.<a id="FNanchor_1413_1413" href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> “All in the household,”
Mommsen remarks, “were destitute of legal rights—the wife
and the child no less than the bullock or the slave.”<a id="FNanchor_1414_1414" href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a>
Even the full-grown son and his children were subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
the house-father’s will,<a id="FNanchor_1415_1415" href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a> and in marriage without <i>conventio
in manum</i> a daughter remained in the power of her father
or tutor after marriage. The consent of the <i>paterfamilias</i> was
indispensable to the marriage of children, sons and daughters
alike;<a id="FNanchor_1416_1416" href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a> and so strict was this rule originally, that down to
the reign of Marcus Aurelius the children of a <i>mente captus</i>
could not contract a legal marriage while in the power of
their father, the latter being incapable of giving his consent.<a id="FNanchor_1417_1417" href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a>
The religious character of this unlimited paternal authority
has been pointed out by M. Fustel de Coulanges. “In
primitive antiquity,” he says, “the father is not only the
strong man, the protector who has power to command
obedience; he is the priest, he is heir to the hearth, the continuator
of the ancestors, the parent stock of the descendants,
the depositary of the mysterious rites of worship, and of
the sacred formulas of prayer. The whole religion resides
in him.”<a id="FNanchor_1418_1418" href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested by Sir Henry Maine and others that
the <i>patria potestas</i> of the Romans was a survival of the
paternal authority which existed among the primitive
Aryans.<a id="FNanchor_1419_1419" href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> But no clear evidence of the general prevalence of
such unlimited authority among other Indo-European peoples
has been adduced. Justinian justly observed, “The power
which we have over our children is peculiar to Roman
citizens; for there are no other men possessing such a power
over their children as we have.”<a id="FNanchor_1420_1420" href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a> That the father, among the
Greeks, Germans, and Celts, had the power to expose his
children when they were very young and to sell his marriageable
daughters, does not imply the possession of a sovereignty
like that which the Roman house-father exercised over his
descendants at all ages. As, however, the family institu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>tion
seems to have had a religious basis among the early
Aryans, the father probably had a higher authority than he
has among any existing uncivilized people.</p>

<p>According to Sir Henry Maine, the fulness of the ancient
Hindu <i>patria potestas</i> may be safely inferred from the veneration
which even a living father must have inspired under a
system of ancestor-worship.<a id="FNanchor_1421_1421" href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> At a later date, the law-book
of Manu declares that three persons—a wife, a son, and a
slave—have in general no wealth exclusively their own;
the wealth which they may earn being regularly acquired for
the man to whom they belong.<a id="FNanchor_1422_1422" href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> A more recent, but still
ancient authority, Narada, says that a son is “of age and
independent, in case his parents be dead; during their lifetime
he is dependent, even though he be grown old.”<a id="FNanchor_1423_1423" href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> And,
speaking of the South of India, Mr. Nelson observes, “It is
an undoubted fact that, amongst the so-called Hindus of the
Madras Province, the father is looked upon by all at the
present day as the Rajah or absolute Sovereign of the family
that depends upon him. He is entitled to reverence during
his life, as he is to worship after his death. His word is law,
to be obeyed without question or demur. He is emphatically
the ‘Master’ of his family, of his wife, of his sons, of his
slaves, and of his wealth.”<a id="FNanchor_1424_1424" href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> But, on the other hand, it appears
from the ‘Rig-Veda’ that, among the ancient Hindus, the
father was the head of the family only as long as he was able
to be its protector and maintainer,<a id="FNanchor_1425_1425" href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> decrepit parents being
even allowed to die of starvation,—a custom which was prevalent
among the ancient Teutons and Eranians.<a id="FNanchor_1426_1426" href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a> Moreover,
according to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ a daughter might choose her
husband in accordance with her own wish. This permission,
however, seems to have been an innovation, as Manu himself
disapproves of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> “voluntary union of a maiden and her
lover, ... which springs from desire and has sexual intercourse
for its purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_1427_1427" href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> The four marriages—Brâhma, Daiva,
Ârsha, and Prâgâpatya—in which the father gives away his
daughter, are blessed marriages, and from them spring sons
radiant with knowledge of the Veda, honoured by good men,
and destined to live a hundred years. But the remaining
four marriages—those effected by purchase, voluntary union,
forcible abduction, or stealth—are blamable marriages, from
which spring sons who are cruel and untruthful, who hate the
Veda and the sacred law.<a id="FNanchor_1428_1428" href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> Among the ancient Persians also,
marriage contracted with the woman’s own consent, but
against the will of her parents, was looked upon as the
worst kind of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1429_1429" href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> In India,<a id="FNanchor_1430_1430" href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a> as well as in Persia,<a id="FNanchor_1431_1431" href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a>
children were often affianced in earliest youth by their
parents.</p>

<p>According to M. Fustel de Coulanges, the unlimited subjection
of the son to the father existed amongst the ancient
Greeks, but disappeared at an early period at Athens, and
somewhat later at Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_1432_1432" href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a> It seems very doubtful, however,
whether this subjection ever was so unlimited as among the
Romans. The relations of Ulysses and Laertes in the
Odyssey indicate that, at least under certain circumstances,
a father in the decrepitude of age could be deposed from the
headship of the family. In the mature Greek jurisprudence,
as Sir Henry Maine points out, the direct authority of the
parent is restricted, as in European codes, to the nonage or
minority of the children.<a id="FNanchor_1433_1433" href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> At Athens, a son was in his
father’s power till twenty years of age; then he could marry
without paternal sanction.<a id="FNanchor_1434_1434" href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> Women, on the other hand, were
in a state of nonage throughout life. A woman could not be
a party to any act of importance without the consent of her
guardians, whose rights, after her marriage, passed to the
husband. As a rule, it was the lot of a Greek woman to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
given in marriage to a man whom she did not know.<a id="FNanchor_1435_1435" href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> “Les
femmes, à Athènes,” says M. Cauvet, “ne devaient jamais
choisir elles-mêmes leur époux, toujours il leur était
par le tuteur que la loi leur donnait.”<a id="FNanchor_1436_1436" href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> At Sparta, as well as
at Athens, the betrothal of the bride by her father or guardian
was requisite as an introduction to marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1437_1437" href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a></p>

<p>Among the Teutons, the father certainly had the power to
expose or sell his children under age, but an adult son could
put his infirm and aged parents to death.<a id="FNanchor_1438_1438" href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> “Quelle que soit la
ressemblance des deux institutions,” says M. Laboulaye, “on
ne peut pas confondre la puissance paternelle (<i>patria potestas</i>)
des Romains et la puissance paternelle des barbares, le <i>mundium</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_1439_1439" href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a>
Far from being, as in Rome, a power throughout life,
the <i>mundium</i> over a son ceased as soon as he was able to shift
for himself.<a id="FNanchor_1440_1440" href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> M. Pardessus asserts that, at any rate in the
fifth and sixth centuries, such paternal authority as a Roman
father exerted did not exist among the Franks;<a id="FNanchor_1441_1441" href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a> and an old
commentator states that, “by the law of the Langobardi,
children are not under the ‘power’ of the father.” Nevertheless,
the <i>mundium</i> among these people was more severe than
among any other of the Teutonic nations.<a id="FNanchor_1442_1442" href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> The extent of the
father’s rights in earlier times, when the Teutons had no
written laws, we do not definitely know; but, according to
Tacitus, a house-father had not unlimited power even over
his slaves;<a id="FNanchor_1443_1443" href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a> so it is impossible to believe in the prevalence of
a <i>patria potestas</i> of the Roman type among them. In choosing
a wife, however, the men had apparently in early days to
take counsel with their kinsfolk.<a id="FNanchor_1444_1444" href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> “The parents and relations
of the parties,” says Tacitus, “are consulted in cases of
marriage, and determine the nature of the bridal gifts.”<a id="FNanchor_1445_1445" href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a>
Women always remained in a state of dependence. Girls,
wives, or widows, they were under the guardianship of the
father, husband, or nearest male relative. The father could
freely dispose of his daughter’s hand, and her own inclinations
seem to have been very little taken into consideration.<a id="FNanchor_1446_1446" href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a></p>

<p>According to ancient Russian laws, fathers had great
power over the children;<a id="FNanchor_1447_1447" href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> but Macieiowski thinks it improbable
that a son could be sold as a slave.<a id="FNanchor_1448_1448" href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> Baron von
Haxthausen, who wrote before the Emancipation in 1861,
says, “The patriarchal government, feelings, and organization
are in full activity in the life, manners, and customs of the
Great Russians. The same unlimited authority which the
father exercises over all his children is possessed by the mother
over her daughters.... The Russian addresses the same
word to his real father, to the Starosta (a communal authority),
to his proprietor, to the Emperor, and finally to God, <i>viz.</i>, Father
(‘Batushka’).”<a id="FNanchor_1449_1449" href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> According to Sir Mackenzie Wallace, however,
the head of the household was rather the administrator of a
labour association than a house-father in the proper sense of the
term. The house and nearly everything it contained were the
joint-property of the family, and not even the head of it could
sell or buy anything without the express or tacit consent of all
the other grown-up men.<a id="FNanchor_1450_1450" href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> In Poland, according to Nestor, a
father used to select a bride for his son;<a id="FNanchor_1451_1451" href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> and in Russia,
previous to the Emancipation, it was a common custom for
fathers to marry their young sons to full-grown women. According
to Professor Bogišić, the power of the father is not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
great among the South Slavonians as among the Russians.<a id="FNanchor_1452_1452" href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a>
But Dr. Krauss asserts that a son is not permitted to make a
proposal of marriage to a girl against the will of his parents;
and, among the Croatians and Servians, it is quite exceptional
for the young man himself to look about for his future wife.<a id="FNanchor_1453_1453" href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a>
A daughter, of course, enjoys still less freedom of disposing
of her own hand.<a id="FNanchor_1454_1454" href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The paternal authority of the archaic type here considered
formed only a transitional stage in the history of human institutions.
It declined gradually, according as the religious
basis on which it rested became more unstable. The introduction
of a new religion with higher conceptions of human
rights particularly contributed to its fall. Paying special
attention to its influence on the laws of marriage, I shall
endeavour to trace the main features of this highly important
process, which released children from paternal
despotism.</p>

<p>Among the Hebrews, a modification of the patriarchal
principle took place as early as the seventh century before the
Christian era;<a id="FNanchor_1455_1455" href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a> and, according to the Talmudic law, a marriage,
to be valid, must be contracted with the voluntary consent of
both the parties concerned.<a id="FNanchor_1456_1456" href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a> In Arabia, Mohammed limited
the paternal power.<a id="FNanchor_1457_1457" href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a> According to all the Mohammedan
schools, a son is at liberty to contract a marriage without his
father’s consent, after he has completed his fifteenth year. The
Hanafîs and Shiahs grant the same privilege to a daughter,
whereas, according to other schools, a woman is emancipated
from paternal control only through marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1458_1458" href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> A Mohammedan
father certainly has the right to impose the <i>status</i> of marriage
on his children during their minority, sons and daughters
alike, but the law takes particular care that this right shall
never be exercised to the prejudice of the infant. Any act of
the father which is likely to injure the interest of the minor
is considered illegal, and entitles the judge to interfere in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
order to prevent the completion of such act, or, if complete,
to annul it.<a id="FNanchor_1459_1459" href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a></p>

<p>In the mature Greek jurisprudence the paternal power was
more restricted than during the Homeric age;<a id="FNanchor_1460_1460" href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a> and the
Roman <i>patria potestas</i> gradually became a shadow of what
it had been. Under the Republic the abuses of paternal
authority were checked by the censors, and in later times the
Emperors reduced the father’s power within comparatively
narrow limits. Alexander Severus ordained that severe
punishments should be inflicted on members of a family only
by the magistrate. Diocletian and Maximilian took away
the power of selling freeborn children as slaves; and Constantine
declared the father who killed his child guilty of
murder.<a id="FNanchor_1461_1461" href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> The father’s privilege of dictating marriage for his
sons declined into a conditional veto;<a id="FNanchor_1462_1462" href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a> and it seems as if
daughters also, at length, gained a certain amount of freedom
in the choice of a husband. At any rate, a daughter could
protest, if the father wished to give her in marriage to a man
with a bad reputation.<a id="FNanchor_1463_1463" href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a></p>

<p>“La philosophie stoïcienne et le christianisme,” says M.
Koenigswarter, “qui hâtèrent le développement des principes
d’égalité, furent surtout favorables aux fils de famille et
aux femmes.”<a id="FNanchor_1464_1464" href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a> The influence of Christianity shows itself in
Teutonic legislation as well as in Roman. An edict of
Clothaire I. in 560 prohibited the forcing of women to marry
against their will;<a id="FNanchor_1465_1465" href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a> although a Council held at Paris three
years earlier expressly required the consent of the parents
also.<a id="FNanchor_1466_1466" href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> According to the laws of Cnut, no woman or girl could
be forced to marry a man whom she disliked.<a id="FNanchor_1467_1467" href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a> The Swedish
‘Westgöta-lag’ permitted a woman to dissolve a marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
which had been contracted without her consent;<a id="FNanchor_1468_1468" href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> and similar
privileges were granted to her in the ‘Uplands-lag’<a id="FNanchor_1469_1469" href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a> and
certain other Teutonic law-books.<a id="FNanchor_1470_1470" href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> Later on, the ‘Schwabenspiegel’—a
faithful echo of canonical ideas—says,
“When a young man has completed his fourteenth year, he
can take a wife without the consent of his father.... At
twelve years, a maiden is marriageable; and the marriage
subsists, even if contracted in spite of her father, or other
relatives.”<a id="FNanchor_1471_1471" href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> A similar privilege, during the Middle Ages, was
granted to German women in general.<a id="FNanchor_1472_1472" href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> But the feelings of
the people seemed to have been opposed to it, and required
the consent of the parents. Thus Ulrich von Lichtenstein
says in his ‘Frauenbuch,’ “A girl who has no parents
should follow the advice of her kinsfolk; if she gives
herself to a man of her own accord, she may live with
shame.”<a id="FNanchor_1473_1473" href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a></p>

<p>Paternal authority has declined more rapidly in some
countries than in others. The process has been especially
slow in France. In the literature of the eleventh century,
says M. Bernard, the paternal character is “everywhere
honoured, and filial piety everywhere praised and rewarded.
In the romances of chivalry fathers are never ridiculous; nor
sons insolent and mocking.... Above the majesty of the
feudal baron, that of the paternal power was held still more
sacred and inviolable. However powerful the son might be,
he would not have dared to outrage his father, whose
authority was in his eyes always confounded with the
sovereignty of command.”<a id="FNanchor_1474_1474" href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> This respect exercised a
tyrannical dominion for centuries. Du Vair remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> “Nous
devons tenir nos pères comme des dieux en terre.”<a id="FNanchor_1475_1475" href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> Bodin
wrote, in the later part of the sixteenth century, that, though
the monarch commands his subjects, the master his disciples,
the captain his soldiers, there is none to whom nature has
given any command except the father, “who is the true
image of the great sovereign God, universal father of all
things.”<a id="FNanchor_1476_1476" href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> In the Duke of Sully’s ‘Memoirs’ we read that, in
his days in France, children were not permitted to sit in the
presence of their parents without being commanded to do
so.<a id="FNanchor_1477_1477" href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> According to the edicts of Henry III. (1566), Louis
XIII. (1639), and Louis XIV. (1697), sons could not marry
before the age of thirty, nor daughters before that of twenty-five,
without the consent of the father and mother, on pain of
being disinherited.<a id="FNanchor_1478_1478" href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a> Speaking of the women among the
nobility and upper classes in France during the eighteenth
century, Messrs. de Goncourt remark, “Généralement le
mariage de la jeune fille se faisait presque immédiatement au
sortir du couvent, avec un mari accepté et agréé par la
famille. Car le mariage était avant tout une affaire de
famille, un arrangement au gré des parents, qui décidaient
des considérations de position et d’argent, des convenances de
rang et de fortune. Le choix était fait d’avance pour la jeune
personne, qui n’était pas consultée.”<a id="FNanchor_1479_1479" href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a></p>

<p>Even now French law accords considerable power to
parents. A child cannot quit the paternal residence without
the permission of the father before the age of twenty-one
except for enrolment in the army.<a id="FNanchor_1480_1480" href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a> For grave misconduct
by his children the father has strong means of correction.<a id="FNanchor_1481_1481" href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a>
A son under twenty-five and a daughter under twenty-one
cannot marry without the consent of their parents;<a id="FNanchor_1482_1482" href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a> and,
even when a man has attained his twenty-fifth year, and
the woman her twenty-first, both are still bound to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
for it, by a formal notification.<a id="FNanchor_1483_1483" href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> Parental restraints upon
marriage exist to a very great extent in Germany and
Holland also, the marriage of minors being absolutely
void, if effected without the consent of the father, or of
the mother if she be the survivor. According to American,
Scotch, and Irish law, on the other hand, the consent
of parents and guardians to the marriage of minors is not
requisite to the validity of the union. The same was the
case in England prior to the statute of 26 Geo. II. c. 33,
which declared all marriages by license, when either of the
parties was under the age of twenty-one years, if celebrated
without publication of banns, or without the consent of the
father or unmarried mother, or guardian to be absolutely
null and void.<a id="FNanchor_1484_1484" href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a></p>

<p>There is thus a certain resemblance between the family
institution of savage tribes and that of the most advanced
races. Among both, the grown-up son, and frequently the
grown-up daughter, enjoys a liberty unknown among peoples
at an intermediate stage of civilization. There are, however,
these vital differences:—that children in civilized countries
are in no respect the property of their parents; that they are
born with certain rights guaranteed to them by society; that
the birth of children gives parents no rights over them other
than those which conduce to the children’s happiness. These
ideas, essential as they are to true civilization, are not many
centuries old. It is a purely modern conception the French
Encyclopedist expresses when he says, “Le pouvoir paternel
est plutôt un devoir qu’un pouvoir.”<a id="FNanchor_1485_1485" href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<small>SEXUAL SELECTION AMONG ANIMALS</small></h2>


<p>The expression, “Sexual Selection,” was first used by Mr.
Darwin. Besides natural selection, which depends on the
success of both sexes, at all ages, in relation to the general
conditions of life, he introduced another principle, sexual
selection, which depends on the success of certain individuals
over others of the same sex, in relation to the propagation of
the species. According to the former principle, those individuals
who are most successful in the struggle for existence
survive the others, and characters useful to the species are
thus inherited; according to the latter, those individuals who
have the greatest success in the struggle for mates have the
most numerous offspring, and the characters which gave them
the preference pass on to the new generation, and are afterwards
intensified by the operation of like causes. The sexual
struggle is of two kinds. In both it is carried on by individuals
of the same sex; but in one these individuals, generally
the males, try to drive away or kill their rivals; in the
other, they seek to excite or charm those of the opposite sex,
generally the females, who select the most attractive males
for their partners. Therefore, the characters acquired through
sexual selection, and transmitted chiefly to offspring of the
same sex, generally the males, are, on the one hand, weapons
for battle, vigour and courage; on the other hand, certain
colours, forms, ornaments, sounds, or odours, which are felt
to be pleasant. The secondary sexual characters of the latter
sort are thus due to the taste of the females. They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
been acquired because they are beautiful or otherwise agreeable,
whereas the characters resulting from natural selection
have been acquired because they are useful. How are we to
explain the origin of this wonderful æsthetic faculty? “The
senses of man and of the lower animals,” says Mr. Darwin,
“seem to be so constituted that brilliant colours and certain
forms, as well as harmonious and rhythmical sounds, give
pleasure and are called beautiful; but why this should be so
we know not.”<a id="FNanchor_1486_1486" href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a> According to Mr. Darwin, natural and
sexual selection are two different sources from which animal
characters have arisen. There is some truth in the statement
of one of his critics, “Mr. Darwin, in fact, has so far abandoned
his former belief in the efficacy of ‘natural selection’
as an agent in producing the differences which separate
different species of animals, as to admit that some supplementary
cause must, in some cases at any rate, be looked
for; and this he thinks is to be found in the action, through
long periods, of ‘sexual selection.’”<a id="FNanchor_1487_1487" href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a></p>

<p>Far from co-operating with the process of natural selection,
sexual selection, as described by Mr. Darwin, produces effects
disadvantageous to the species. “It is evident,” he says,
“that the brilliant colours, top-knots, fine plumes, &amp;c., of
many male birds cannot have been acquired as a protection;
indeed, they sometimes lead to danger.”<a id="FNanchor_1488_1488" href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a> When we consider
what an important part is played by colours, as means of
protection, in the whole animal kingdom, it is certainly surprising
that many male animals display brilliant hues, which
cannot fail to make them conspicuous to their enemies. The
strong odours emitted by certain reptiles and mammals,
during the pairing season, and the sounds produced by various
species at the same period, have also the effect of
attracting hostile animals that are searching for food. And
the danger arising for the species from these secondary
sexual characters is all the greater because they generally
appear at the time when offspring is about to be produced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Thus, besides colours, structures, and functions, adapted in
the most marvellous way to the requirements of each species,
there are others highly dangerous, which, according to Mr.
Darwin, depend upon an æsthetic sense, the origin of which
we do not know, and which is absolutely useless.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, in his many works, has shown how immense
is the influence exercised by natural selection on the organic
world. A disciple, therefore, naturally feels perplexed when
he is told of a series of facts, which, according to the explanation
given by the master, are opposed to natural
selection. When the contradiction between the theories of
natural and sexual selection is distinctly realized, the question
arises:—Can we be sure that the secondary sexual
characters are so useless as Mr. Darwin suggests? May not
they also be explained by the principle of the survival of the
fittest? The larger size and greater strength of the males,
and the weapons of offence or defence many of them possess,
may easily be so accounted for, as, among the higher animals,
the males generally fight with each other for the possession
of the females. The point is whether the other secondary
sexual characters can be due to the same cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is an established fact that the colours of flowers serve a
definite end. Through them the flowers are recognized by
insects in search of honey; and the insects, during their visits,
involuntarily carry the pollen of one flower to the stigma of
another, and thus effect cross-fertilization, which is proved to
be of great importance for the vigour and fertility of the next
generation of plants. Now it is extremely interesting to note
that brilliant colours are found only in species of flowers to
which they are useful as means of attracting insects; they
never occur in plants which are fertilized by the wind.<a id="FNanchor_1489_1489" href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> Mr.
Wallace observes that plants rarely need to be concealed,
because they obtain protection by their spines, or their hardness,
or their hairy covering, or their poisonous secretions.
Hence there are very few cases of what seems to be true protective
colouring among them.<a id="FNanchor_1490_1490" href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> In animals, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
colour is greatly influenced by their need of protection from,
or warning to, their numerous enemies; colours of other kinds
must always, to a certain extent, be dangerous for the species.
Is it probable, then, that, whilst gay colours occur only in the
flowers of those plants to which they are of real use, conspicuous
colours should occur in animals to which they are of
real danger—merely because the females find them beautiful?</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, whose well-known criticism of Mr. Darwin’s
theory of sexual selection<a id="FNanchor_1491_1491" href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> seems, in many points, to be conclusive,
suggests that the very frequent superiority of the male
bird or insect in brightness or intensity of colour is due to
the greater vigour and activity and the higher vitality of the
male. This intensity of coloration is therefore most manifest
in the male during the breeding season, when the vitality is
at a maximum. It would be further developed by the combats
of the males for the possession of the females; and the
most vigorous and energetic usually leaving the most numerous
and most healthy offspring, natural selection would indirectly
become a preserver and intensifier of colour.<a id="FNanchor_1492_1492" href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> Mr.
Wallace has made it very probable that there is some connection
between vigour and colour, but another question is
whether this connection, depending on some unknown physiological
law, is so necessary that it takes place even when
colour is positively disadvantageous to the species. Nothing
of the kind is found in the vegetable kingdom. We know,
as Mr. Wallace himself remarks, that colours which rarely or
never appear in the species in a state of nature, continually
occur among cultivated plants and domesticated animals—a
fact which shows that the capacity to develop colour is ever
present.<a id="FNanchor_1493_1493" href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> Among wild plants such colour variations are
never preserved except when they are useful. Is it not most
reasonable to suppose that the like is the case with animals?</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that colour subserves the same purpose
in both of the great kingdoms of the organic world.
Just as flowers are coloured that insects may recognize where
honey is to be found, and thus may be led to promote fertil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>ization,
so the sexual colours of animals have been developed
to make it easier for the sexes to find each other during the
pairing time. Protective colours are useful so far as they
conceal the animal from its enemies, but, at the same time,
they conceal it from individuals of its own species. Sexual
colours are therefore useful as well, because they make the
animal more visible. It is quite in accordance with the
theory of natural selection that, where such colours occur,
the advantage from them should be greater than the disadvantage.
We can see the reason for the brilliant colours
of humming-birds, as these birds, on account of their
great activity “are practically unmolested,”<a id="FNanchor_1494_1494" href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a> and for the
bright hues of the rose chafers, who are saved from attack by
a combination of protecting characters.<a id="FNanchor_1495_1495" href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a> But generally there
is danger in sexual colours, so that nature has given them
with the utmost cautiousness. Usually they occur in males
only, because of the females’ greater need of protection.<a id="FNanchor_1496_1496" href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a>
They are not developed till the age of reproduction, and they
appear, in a great many species, only during the pairing season.
The greatest advantage is won with the least possible peril.</p>

<p>It is a fact of great importance that sexual colours occur
exactly in those species whose habits make these colours
most visible. Thus the nocturnal moths, taken as a body, are
much less gaily decorated than butterflies, all of which are
diurnal in their habits, although, according to Mr. Wallace,
the general influence of solar light and heat is no adequate
cause for the variety, intensity, and complexity of the colours.
The females of the ghost moth are yellow with darker markings,
whereas the males are white, that they may be more
easily seen by the females whilst flying about in the dusk;
and it is remarkable that, in the Shetland Islands, the male
of this moth, instead of differing widely from the female,
frequently resembles her closely in colour,—as Mr. Fraser
suggests,<a id="FNanchor_1497_1497" href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> because, at the season of the year when the ghost
moth appears in these northern latitudes, the whiteness of
the males is not needed to render them visible to the females<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
in the twilight night. Both Mr. Darwin<a id="FNanchor_1498_1498" href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a> and Mr. Wallace<a id="FNanchor_1499_1499" href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a>
think that, in this case, colour may be a means of recognition.
Sexual colours occur chiefly in species which, because of
their manner of living, are to be seen at a distance; they
seldom occur in sedentary or slowly moving terrestrial
animals.<a id="FNanchor_1500_1500" href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> The members of the lowly organized order Thysanura
are wingless and dull-coloured. The Hemiptera, which
usually lurk about plants, and prey upon hapless insects, are
not, as a rule, remarkable for conspicuous hues. The Orthoptera
are all terrestrial in their habits, generally feeding upon
plants, and, although some exotic locusts are beautifully
ornamented, their bright tints, according to Mr. Darwin, do
not seem to fall under the head of sexual coloration. On
the other hand, the dragon-flies, which live in the open air,
possess splendid green, blue, yellow, and vermilion metallic
tints, and the sexes often differ in their coloration. Every one
has admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies, especially
of the males. Amongst the Fishes, living in a medium
through which bright colours may be observed at a distance,
we often find, besides protective colours, conspicuous hues
which are especially intense and visible during the pairing
time. Among the Reptiles, the little lizards of the genus
Draco especially deserve attention; they glide through the
air on their rib-supported parachutes, and the beauty of their
colours baffles description. Mammals, on the other hand,
do not generally present the splendid tints so common among
male birds; and the brighter colours of certain arboreal mammals
serve chiefly as means of concealment.</p>

<p>These phenomena seem to show that sexual colours have
been evolved for the purpose of <i>being seen</i>. They can
scarcely be due merely to the fact that coloration is
connected with the degree of vitality, since the Mammals,
for instance, are certainly not less vigorous than
any of the other Vertebrate orders. It may perhaps be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
suggested that, as flying animals more easily escape their
enemies than terrestrial, they may with less danger be decorated
with conspicuous hues. But here we have to observe
the most important fact, that animals which do not possess
sexual colours generally have some other means of making
themselves discoverable.</p>

<p>Flowers which need the help of insects for fertilization attract
them, in some cases, not by bright colours, but by peculiar
odours. And as we do not find conspicuous colours in plants
fertilized by the wind, so flowers have no perfume except
where it is of real use. The most brilliant flowers, as a rule,
are those which possess least odour, whilst many of them have
no scent at all. White or very pale flowers are generally the
most odoriferous. M. Mongredien gives a list of about 160
species of hardy trees and shrubs with showy flowers, and
another list of sixty species with fragrant flowers; but only
twenty of the latter are included among the showy species,
and these are almost all white-flowered.<a id="FNanchor_1501_1501" href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> Most of the white
flowers are scented only at night, or their perfumes are most
powerfully emitted at that time; the reason being that white
flowers are fertilized chiefly by night-flying insects. We arrive
thus at two conclusions: first, that powerful odours and conspicuous
colours as guides to insect fertilizers are, as a rule,
complementary to each other; secondly, that they occur
alternately in the way most useful to the species.</p>

<p>In the animal kingdom various odours and sounds are
closely connected with the reproduction of the species.
During the season of love a musky odour is emitted by the
submaxillary glands of the crocodile, and pervades its
haunts. At the same period the anal scent-glands of snakes
are in active function, and so are the corresponding glands of
the lizards. Many mammals are odoriferous. In some cases
the odour appears to serve as a defence or a protection, but in
other species the glands are confined to the males, and almost
always become more active during the rutting season. Again,
a great many insects have the power of producing stridulous
sounds. In two families of the Homoptera and in three of
the Orthoptera, the males alone possess organs of sound in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
an efficient state, and these are used incessantly during the
pairing season. Some male fishes have sound-producing
instruments, and the fishermen of Rochelle assert that the
males alone make the noise during the spawning-time. Of
frogs and toads the males emit various sounds at the pairing
time, as in the case of the croaking of our common frog.
During the rutting season, and at no other time, the male of
the huge tortoise of the Galapagos Islands utters a hoarse
bellowing noise, which can be heard at a distance of more
than a hundred yards. Professor Aughey states that on two
occasions, being himself unseen, he watched from a little distance
a rattle-snake coiled up with head erect, which continued
to rattle at short intervals for half an hour; at last he saw
another snake approach, and when they met they paired.
Among Birds the power of song, or of giving forth strange
cries, or even instrumental music, is exceedingly common,
particularly in the males during the pairing season; and
almost all male mammals use their voices much more during
that period than at any other time. Some, as the giraffe and
porcupine, are stated to be completely mute except during
the rutting season.</p>

<p>The colours, odours, and sounds of animals, like the colours
and odours of plants—so far as they may be assumed to be in
some way connected with the reproductive functions—are, as
a rule, complementary to each other. Stridulating insects are
generally not conspicuously coloured. Among the Homoptera,
there do not seem to be any well-marked cases of ornamental
differences between the sexes. Among crickets, the Locustidæ,
and grasshoppers, some species are beautifully coloured; but
Mr. Darwin says, “It is not probable that they owe their
bright tints to sexual selection. Conspicuous colours may be
of use to these insects by giving notice that they are unpalatable.”
Other species have directly protective colours. The
bright hues of stridulating beetles seem to be of use chiefly
for protective and warning purposes; whereas species belonging
to the orders Neuroptera and Lepidoptera, often extremely
conspicuously coloured, are not remarkable for any stridulous
sounds. Frogs and toads, which have an interesting sexual
character in the musical powers possessed by the males, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
evidently coloured according to the principle of protection, or
sometimes tinted with conspicuous hues in order to be more
easily recognized by their enemies as a nauseous food. Of
Reptiles, the Lacertilia excel mainly in bright tints; the
Chelonia, Crocodilia, and Ophidia, in sounds and odours.
Among Birds, in one instance at least, the male is remarkable
for his scent. “During the pairing and breeding season,”
says Mr. Gould, with reference to the Australian musk-duck,
“ ... this bird emits a strong musky odour;” it is not
ornamented with any conspicuous hues.<a id="FNanchor_1502_1502" href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> Sexual colours and
the power of song are generally complementary to each other
among Birds. “As a general rule,” Mr. Wood remarks, “it
is found that the most brilliant songsters among the birds are
attired in the plainest garb; and it may safely be predicted
of any peculiarly gorgeous bird, that power, quality and
sweetness of voice are in inverse ratio to its beauty of
plumage.”<a id="FNanchor_1503_1503" href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> Thus, of the British birds, with the exception of
the bullfinch and goldfinch, the best songsters are plain-coloured,
and the brilliant birds of the tropics are hardly ever
songsters. The wild camel in the desert of Kum-tagh has a
reddish, sandy hue, and the males, “even during the rutting
season, utter no sound, but find their consorts by scent.”<a id="FNanchor_1504_1504" href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a>
The musk-deer, well known for the intolerable perfume which
the males emit at the pairing time, is also entirely silent.<a id="FNanchor_1505_1505" href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a></p>

<p>Moreover, as appears from what has just been said, the
sexual colours, the perceptible scents and sounds of animals are
complementary to each other in the way that is best suited
to make the animals easily discoverable. As bright colours
would be of no advantage to flowers fertilized by night-flying
insects, so they would be of comparatively little advantage
to animals living among grass and plants, in woods and
bushes; whereas sounds and scents make the animal recognizable
at a considerable distance. We have also seen that it
is among flying and aquatic animals that sexual colours
chiefly occur, whereas terrestrial animals excel in sound and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
scents. Thus most of the stridulating insects are terrestrial.
Whilst brightly-coloured lizards, living on trees or running
from stone to stone, must attract attention by the brilliance
of their covering, crocodiles inhabiting rivers and jungles,
and frogs crawling among the grass, allure their mates, the
former by emitting musky odours, the latter by producing
loud sounds. The odour of the Australian musk-duck, which
depends for its food and for its preservation from danger upon
its powers of diving rather than upon those of flying, is, as
Mr. Gould observes, often perceptible long before the animal
can be seen.<a id="FNanchor_1506_1506" href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a></p>

<p>Mr. Darwin remarks, as regards birds, “Bright colours and
the power of song seem to replace each other. We can perceive
that, if the plumage did not vary in brightness, or if
bright colours were dangerous to the species, other means
would be employed to charm the females; and melody of
voice offers one such means.”<a id="FNanchor_1507_1507" href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> But if we accept Mr. Darwin’s
theory of sexual selection, we are compelled to suppose that
that inexplicable æsthetic sense of the females has been
developed in the way most dangerous to the species. Conspicuous
colours are admired by the females of those animals
which, by means of such colours, are most easily discovered
by their enemies, and sounds and odours are appreciated
exactly in those species to which they are most perilous. If,
on the contrary, we accept the explanation that, although
sexual colours, odours, and sounds are in some ways hurtful
to the species, they are upon the whole advantageous, inasmuch
as they make it easier for the sexes to find each other,
we have a theory in accordance with all known facts, as well
as with the great principle of natural selection. It may be
objected that it is not the females but the males that are the
seekers, whilst the secondary sexual characters generally
occur in the males only. But we have no reason to think
that the females are entirely passive during the pairing
season; and several of the statements collected by Mr.
Darwin directly indicate that females are attracted by the
sounds of their future partners. If Burdach is correct in say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>ing
that the male sex generally possesses more acute senses
than the female,<a id="FNanchor_1508_1508" href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a> it is obvious that secondary sexual characters
would be of less use to females than to males, as it certainly
would be of greater danger.</p>

<p>In his work on ‘Darwinism,’ Mr. Wallace expresses the
opinion that the various sounds and odours which are peculiar
to the male serve as a call to the female, or as an indication
of his presence; and, as he says, “the production, intensification,
and differentiation of these sounds and odours are
clearly within the power of natural selection.”<a id="FNanchor_1509_1509" href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> Mr. Wallace
has also shown the immense importance of colour as a means
of recognition. The theory here set forth thus, in fact, very
nearly approaches his views. The only difference is that the
sexual colours have been classified under the head of “colour
for recognition,” though the positive cause by which they
have been produced may be a surplus of vital energy.</p>

<p>We have still to consider certain secondary sexual characters
which, according to Mr. Darwin, must be regarded as
ornaments. With these he classes the great horns which rise
from the head, thorax, and clypeus of many male beetles;
the appendages with which some male fishes and reptiles are
provided; the combs, plumes, crests, and protuberances of
many male birds; and various crests, tufts, and mantles of
hair which are found in certain mammals. But some of these
characters may be of use to the males in their fights for
females, or serve as means of recognition. Mr. Wallace
suggests that crests and other erectile feathers may have been
useful in making the bird more formidable in appearance,
and in thus frightening away enemies; while long tail or
wing feathers might serve to distract the aim of a bird of
prey.<a id="FNanchor_1510_1510" href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> Moreover, characters of which we cannot yet perceive
the use may in the future be brought under the law of
utility, as has been the case in so many other instances. According
to Mr. Wallace, the ornamental appendages of birds
and other animals are due to a surplus of vital energy, leading
to abnormal growths in those parts of the integument where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
muscular and nervous action are greatest.<a id="FNanchor_1511_1511" href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a> And where these
“ornaments” are of no positive disadvantage to the species,
certainly no other explanation is needed.</p>

<p>For other arguments which may be advanced against Mr.
Darwin’s theory of sexual selection, reference may be made
to Mr. Wallace’s criticisms in ‘Tropical Nature’ and
‘Darwinism.’ We have sufficient evidence that females are
pleased or excited by the males’ display of their sexual
colours,<a id="FNanchor_1512_1512" href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> and are charmed by their songs. But Mr. Darwin’s
theory presupposes, amongst many other things, that almost
all the females of a species, over a wide area and for many
successive generations, prefer exactly the same modification
of the colour, or ornament or sounds.<a id="FNanchor_1513_1513" href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> Moreover, if the
secondary sexual characters are due to female choice, how
shall we explain the strange fact that the taste of the females
varies so much that there are scarcely two species in which
the standard of perfection is exactly the same? This difficulty
did not escape Mr. Darwin. “It is a curious fact,” he
says, “that in the same class of animals sounds so different
as the drumming of the snipe’s tail, the tapping of the woodpecker’s
beak, the harsh trumpet-like cry of certain waterfowl,
the cooing of the turtle-dove, and the song of the nightingale,
should all be pleasing to the females of the several
species.” And further, “What shall we say about the harsh
screams of, for instance, some kinds of macaws; have these
birds as bad taste for musical sounds as they apparently
have for colour, judging by the inharmonious contrast of
their bright yellow and blue plumage?”<a id="FNanchor_1514_1514" href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a></p>

<p>The theory now suggested accounts fully for this difference
in taste. The immense variability of the secondary sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
characters is precisely what might be expected, if their object
is to make it easier for the sexes to find and recognize each
other. And it is natural that the females should be pleased
by colours, odours, or sounds which, by the association of
ideas, are to them the symbols of the most exciting period of
their lives. On the other hand, we know that differently
coloured races of the same species may be disinclined to pair
together.<a id="FNanchor_1515_1515" href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> And here, I think, we may draw an important
conclusion. The great stability of the secondary sexual
characters which we find in wild species, but certainly not in
animals under domestication, seems to be due chiefly to the
fact that those males which most typically represent the
peculiarities of their species have the best chance of finding
mates.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reader may have felt some surprise at this strange
jump from the <i>patria potestas</i> to a discussion of merely zoological
facts, which have nothing to do, directly, with the
history of human marriage. But we have now to deal with
the sexual selection of man, and, for the right understanding
of this, it was necessary to show that the sexual selection of
the lower animals is entirely subordinate to the great law of
natural selection. Mr. Darwin discussed the origin of the
secondary sexual characters as a preliminary to the statement
of his theory regarding the origin of man, and of the different
races of men. At the end of the next chapter we shall consider
whether this theory appears to be in accordance with
facts or not.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />

<small>THE SEXUAL SELECTION OF MAN: TYPICAL BEAUTY</small></h2>


<p>By the “Sexual Selection of Man” is meant the choice
made by men and women as regards relations with the opposite
sex. Mr. Darwin has shown that such selection takes
place among the lower Vertebrata, and, judging from what we
know of domesticated animals, it is much more common in
the case of females than in that of males. The male, indeed,
as a rule, seems to be ready to pair with any female, provided
she belongs to his own species.<a id="FNanchor_1516_1516" href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a> As this probably depends
upon the great strength of his sexual impulse, we may infer
that in primitive times, when man had a definite pairing
season, he displayed a like tendency, and that the sexual
instinct, in proportion as it has become less intense, has
become more discriminating.</p>

<p>Even now woman is more particular in her choice than
man, provided that the union takes place without reference
to interest. A Maori proverb says, “Let a man be ever so
good-looking, he will not be much sought after; but let a
woman be ever so plain, men will still eagerly seek after
her.”<a id="FNanchor_1517_1517" href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a> With regard to the Negroes of Sogno, Merolla da
Sorrento states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> “Women would have experience of their
husbands before they married them, in like manner as the
men were to have of them; and in this particular I can aver
that they are commonly much more obstinate or fickle than
men, for I have known many instances in which the men
were willing to be married, while the women held back, and
either fled away or made excuses.”<a id="FNanchor_1518_1518" href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> Among the Eastern
Central Africans, according to Mr. Macdonald, many cases
are known of slave wives running away from free husbands,
but none of slave husbands running away from free wives.<a id="FNanchor_1519_1519" href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a>
In the crossings between unequal human races, the father
almost always belongs to the superior race. “In every case,”
says M. de Quatrefages, “and especially in transient amours,
woman refuses to lower herself; man is less delicate.”<a id="FNanchor_1520_1520" href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a> Thus,
cases in which negresses form unions with the indigenous
men of America are very rare;<a id="FNanchor_1521_1521" href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a> and Dr. Nott, who wrote in
the middle of this century, never personally met any one who
was the offspring of a negro man and a white woman,
because of the extreme rarity of such half-breeds.<a id="FNanchor_1522_1522" href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> In New
Zealand it sometimes happens that a European man marries
a Maori woman; but Mr. Kerry Nicholls never came across
an instance where a European woman had married a Maori
man.<a id="FNanchor_1523_1523" href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> Even in civilized society men are less particular in
their connections than women of corresponding education, no
doubt, would be, even if the rules of everyday morality were
the same for both sexes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this and the following four chapters we shall deal with
the instinctive feelings by which the sexes are guided in the
act of selection. We have already observed that the sexual
instinct is excited by artificial means, such as ornaments,
mutilations, &amp;c. Now we have to consider the intrinsic
characters of a human being which affect the passions of a
person of the opposite sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>Mr. Darwin has shown that, among the lower Vertebrata,
the female commonly gives the preference to “the most
vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male,”—a taste the origin of
which is easily accounted for by the theory of natural selection.
A similar instinctive appreciation of manly strength
and courage is found in women, especially in the women of
savage races. In a song, communicated by Mr. Schoolcraft,
an Indian girl gives the following description of her ideal:— “My
love is tall and graceful as the young pine waving on
the hill—And as swift in his course as the noble stately deer—His
hair is flowing, and dark as the blackbird that floats
through the air—And his eyes, like the eagle’s, both piercing
and bright—His heart, it is fearless and great—And his arm,
it is strong in the fight.”<a id="FNanchor_1524_1524" href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> A tale from Madagascar tells of a
princess whose beauty fascinated all men. Many princes
fought to obtain possession of her; but she refused them all,
and chose a lover who was young, handsome, courageous, and
strong.<a id="FNanchor_1525_1525" href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> The beautiful Atalanta gave herself to the best
runner;<a id="FNanchor_1526_1526" href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> and the hero suitors of the Finnish myths had to
undergo difficult trials to prove their courage.<a id="FNanchor_1527_1527" href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> “When a
Dyak wants to marry,” says Mr. Bock, “he must show himself
a hero before he can gain favour with his intended.” He
has to secure a number of human heads by killing men of
hostile tribes; and the more heads he cuts off, the greater
the pride and admiration with which he is regarded by his
bride.<a id="FNanchor_1528_1528" href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> The demands of the Sàkalàva girls of Madagascar
are less cruel. When a young man wishes to obtain a
wife, his qualifications, according to Mr. Sibree, are tested
thus:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>—“Placed at a certain distance from a clever caster
of the spear, he is bidden to catch between his arm and
side every spear thrown by the man opposite to him. If he
displays fear or fails to catch the spear, he is ignominiously
rejected; but if there be no flinching and the spears are
caught, he is at once proclaimed an accepted ‘lover.’” It is
said that a similar custom prevailed among the Bétsiléo,
another Madagascar tribe.<a id="FNanchor_1529_1529" href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a> Among the Dongolowees, as we
are informed by Dr. Felkin, if two men are suitors for a girl,
and there is a difficulty in deciding between the rivals, the
following method is adopted. The fair lady has a knife tied
to each forearm, so fixed that the blade of the knife projects
below the elbow. She then takes up a position on a log
of wood, the young men sitting on either side with their legs
closely pressed against hers. Raising her arms, the girl leans
forward, and slowly presses the knives into the thighs of her
would-be husbands. The suitor who best undergoes this
trial of endurance wins the bride, whose first duty after marriage
is to dress the wounds she has herself inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_1530_1530" href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a>
Speaking of the natives on the River Darling, Major T. L.
Mitchell says that the possession of gins, or wives, appears to
be associated with all their ideas of fighting; “while, on the
other hand, the gins have it in their power on such occasions
to evince that universal characteristic of the fair, a partiality
for the brave. Thus it is, that, after a battle, they do not
always follow their fugitive husbands from the field, but frequently
go over as a matter of course, to the victors.”<a id="FNanchor_1531_1531" href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a></p>

<p>We may infer that women’s instinctive inclination to strong
and courageous men is due to natural selection in two ways.
A strong man is not only father of strong children, but he is
also better able than a weak man to protect his offspring.
The female instinct is especially well marked at the lower
stages of civilization, because bodily vigour is then of most
importance in the struggle for existence. The same principle
explains the attraction which health in a woman has for men.
In civilized society, infirmity and sickliness are not always
a serious hindrance to love, but in a savage state, says
Alexander v. Humboldt, “nothing can induce a man to
unite himself to a deformed woman, or one who is very
unhealthy.”<a id="FNanchor_1532_1532" href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>The ancient Greeks conceived Eros as an extremely handsome
youth, and Aphrodite was the goddess of beauty as
well as of love. So closely are these two ideas—love and
beauty—connected. This connection is not peculiar to the
civilized mind. In Tahiti, Cook saw several instances where
women preferred personal beauty to interest.<a id="FNanchor_1533_1533" href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> The Negroes
of the West African Coast, according to Mr. Winwood
Reade, often discuss the beauty of their women;<a id="FNanchor_1534_1534" href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a> and, among
the cannibal savages of Northern Queensland, described by
Herr Lumholtz, the women take much notice of a man’s face,
especially of the part about the eyes.<a id="FNanchor_1535_1535" href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> But, although in
every country, in every race, beauty stimulates passion, the
ideas of what constitutes beauty vary indefinitely. As Hume
says, “Beauty is no quality in things themselves; it exists
merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind
perceives a different beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_1536_1536" href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a></p>

<p>A flat, retreating brow seems to white men to spoil what
would otherwise be a pretty face; but “the Chinook ideal of
facial beauty,” says Mr. Bancroft, “is a straight line from the
end of the nose to the crown of the head.”<a id="FNanchor_1537_1537" href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> A little snubnose
may embitter the life of a European girl; but the
Australian natives “laugh at the sharp noses of Europeans,
and call them in their language ‘tomahawk noses,’ much
preferring their own style of flat broad noses.”<a id="FNanchor_1538_1538" href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> The
Tahitians frequently said to Mr. Williams, “What a pity it
is that English mothers pull the children’s noses so much, and
make them so frightfully long!”<a id="FNanchor_1539_1539" href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a> We admire white teeth and
rosy cheeks; but a servant of the king of Cochin China spoke
with contempt of the wife of the English ambassador, because
she had white teeth like a dog and a rosy colour like that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
potato flowers.<a id="FNanchor_1540_1540" href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> In the northern parts of the Chinese
Empire, according to Pallas, those women are preferred who
are of the Manchu type,—that is, who have a broad face, high
cheek-bones, very broad noses, and enormous ears;<a id="FNanchor_1541_1541" href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> and the
South American Uaupés consider a swollen calf one of the
chief attractions a young lady can possess, the result being
that girls wear a tight garter below the knee from infancy.<a id="FNanchor_1542_1542" href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a></p>

<p>Even among the Aryan peoples the standard of beauty
varies. “To an honest Fleming, who has never studied design,”
says M. Bombet, “the forms of Rubens’s women are the most
beautiful in the world. Let not us, who admire slenderness
of form above everything else, and to whom the figures even
of Raphael’s women appear rather massive, be too ready to
laugh at him. If we were to consider the matter closely, it
would appear that each individual, and, consequently, each
nation, has a separate idea of beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_1543_1543" href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a></p>

<p>What human characteristics are considered beautiful, and
how has beauty come to influence the sexual selection of
man? In trying to answer these questions, we shall note
only such characteristics as are held to be beautiful by considerable
groups of men, apart from individual differences of
taste; and we shall confine ourselves to physical beauty, as
presenting itself in bodily forms and the colour of the skin.
Mr. Spencer maintains that “mental and facial perfection are
fundamentally connected,” and that “the aspects which please
us are the outward correlatives of inward perfections, while the
aspects which displease us are the outward correlatives of
inward imperfections.”<a id="FNanchor_1544_1544" href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a> But Mr. Spencer evidently looks
upon beauty, or “facial perfection,” as something real in the
sense in which mental qualities are real,—an opinion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
which it is difficult to agree. The lateral jutting-out of the
cheek-bones, which seems to him an index of imperfection, is
admired by many of the lower races.</p>

<p>The full development of those visible properties which are
essential to the human organism is universally recognized as
indispensable to perfect beauty,—natural deformity, the unsymmetrical
shape of the body, apparent traces of disease,
&amp;c., being regarded by every race as unfavourable to personal
appearance. We distinguish between masculine and feminine
beauty, and, in spite of racial differences, the ideas of what
constitute these forms of beauty are fundamentally the same
throughout the world. To be really handsome a person must
approach the ideal type of his or her sex. The male organism
is remarkable for the development of the muscular system, the
female for that of fatty elements; and conspicuous muscles
are everywhere considered to improve the appearance of a
man, rounded forms that of a woman. According to v. Humboldt,
the natives of Guiana, to express the beauty of a
woman, say that “she is fat and has a narrow forehead.”
A traveller found that a Kirghiz’s estimate of female beauty
was regulated by the amount of fat, “for even when dilating
on the beauties of his favourite wife, he laid the greatest stress
on her <i>embonpoint</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_1545_1545" href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a> The Kafirs and Hottentots are charmed
by their women’s long and pendant breasts, which, in certain
tribes, assume such monstrous dimensions, that the usual way
of giving suck, when the child is carried on the back, is by
throwing the breast over the shoulder.<a id="FNanchor_1546_1546" href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> Mr. Reade tells us
that, among the Mpongwé of Gaboon, even very young girls
“strive to emulate the pendant beauties of their seniors.”<a id="FNanchor_1547_1547" href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a>
The Makololo women, according to Dr. Livingstone, make
themselves fat and pretty by drinking a peculiar drink called
“boyáloa”;<a id="FNanchor_1548_1548" href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a> and, among the Trarsa, a Moorish tribe in the
Western Sahara, the women take immense quantities of
milk and butter to make themselves more attractive.<a id="FNanchor_1549_1549" href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
exaggerations, however repugnant to a more refined taste,
indicate a general tendency in men’s notions of female
beauty.</p>

<p>Among Europeans, men are on an average two or three
inches taller than women,<a id="FNanchor_1550_1550" href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a> and have a greater breadth of
shoulder. A high-built and broad-shouldered figure is also
regarded as an ideal of manly beauty, whereas women who
are very tall or broad are apt to be rather awkward. A
woman’s face is shorter, her mouth less broad, her nose less
prominent, her neck longer, her pelvis wider, her waist
narrower than a man’s; and her fingers are more slender and
pointed, her hands and feet smaller. The halving line of a
woman’s body is lower than that of a man’s, so that her steps
are shorter and lighter.<a id="FNanchor_1551_1551" href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a> As a matter of fact, a long face,
a broad mouth, and large hands and feet are much more
objectionable in a woman than in a man. Women have a
special liking for low-bodied dresses, which display the full
length of the neck; and by means of a corset they make the
waist narrower than it is by nature.</p>

<p>There is thus an ideal of beauty which, no doubt, may be
said to be common to the whole human race. But this ideal
is merely an abstraction which can never be realized.
General similarities in taste are accompanied by specific
differences. Though every one admits that a face without a
nose is ugly, no particular form of the nose is universally
admired; and races which regard a swelling bosom as essen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>—
tial to feminine beauty differ widely from the Hottentots as
to the charm of pendant breasts.</p>

<p>Every race has, indeed, its own standard of beauty.
Alexander von Humboldt long ago observed, “Nations
attach the idea of beauty to everything which particularly
characterizes their own physical conformation, their natural
physiognomy. Thence it results that, if nature have bestowed
very little beard, a narrow forehead, or a brownish-red skin,
every individual thinks himself beautiful in proportion as his
body is destitute of hair, his head flattened, his skin more
covered with ‘annotto,’ or ‘chica,’ or some other coppery-red
colour.”<a id="FNanchor_1552_1552" href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a> This view has been adopted by several later
writers,<a id="FNanchor_1553_1553" href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> but, as it has been disputed by others,<a id="FNanchor_1554_1554" href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> it may be
well to bring together some fresh evidence, as an addition to
that collected by Mr. Darwin.</p>

<p>The Sinhalese, says Dr. Davy, who are great connoisseurs
of the charms of the sex, and have books on the subject, and
rules to aid the judgment, would not allow a woman to be perfectly
beautiful unless she had the following characteristics:—“Her
hair should be voluminous like the tail of the peacock,
long, reaching to the knees, and terminating in graceful curls;
her nose should be like the bill of the hawk, and lips bright
and red, like coral on the young leaf of the iron-tree. Her
neck should be large and round, her chest capacious, her
breasts firm and conical, like the yellow cocoa-nut, and her
waist small—almost small enough to be clasped by the hand.
Her lips should be wide; her limbs tapering; the soles of
her feet without any hollow, and the surface of her body in
general, soft, delicate, smooth, and rounded, without the
asperities of projecting bones and sinews.” Dr. Davy adds,
“The preceding is the most general external character that
can be given of the Sinhalese.”<a id="FNanchor_1555_1555" href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a></p>

<p>The women of the Indo-European race are remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
for the length of their hair. “Dans nos contrées,”
Isidore Geoffroy observes, “ces développements ajoutent
à la beauté des femmes; dans d’autres pays, si on les y
observait, ils passeraient presque pour de légers vices de
conformation.”<a id="FNanchor_1556_1556" href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> “A small round face,” says Castrén, “full
rosy red cheeks and lips, white forehead, black tresses, and
small dark eyes are marks of a Samoyede beauty. Thus in
a Samoyedian song a girl is praised for her small eyes, her
broad face, and its rosy colour.”<a id="FNanchor_1557_1557" href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> These, as we know, are the
typical characteristics of the Samoyedes.<a id="FNanchor_1558_1558" href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a> As to the Tartar
women, who generally have far less prominent noses than we
in Europe are accustomed to see, Father de Rubruquis states,
“The less their noses the handsomer they are esteemed.”<a id="FNanchor_1559_1559" href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a>
In Fiji, the remarkably broad occiput, peculiar to its people,
is looked upon as a mark of beauty.<a id="FNanchor_1560_1560" href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> Among the Egyptians
Mr. Lane scarcely ever saw corpulent persons, and, unlike
many other African peoples, they do not admire very fat
women:—“In his love-songs, the Egyptian commonly describes
the object of his affections as of slender figure, and
small waist.”<a id="FNanchor_1561_1561" href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> “The negroes,” says v. Humboldt, “give the
preference to the thickest and most prominent lips; the
Kalmucks to turned-up noses; and the Greeks, in the statues
of heroes, raised the facial line from 85° to 100° beyond
nature. The Aztecs, who never disfigure the heads of their
children, represent their principal divinities, as their hieroglyphical
manuscripts prove, with a head much more
flattened than any I have ever seen among the Caribs.”<a id="FNanchor_1562_1562" href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a></p>

<p>The fashion, prevalent among many peoples, of transforming
parts of the body, affords a good illustration of their ideas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
about personal beauty. The Indians of North America, who
have a low and flat forehead, often exaggerate this natural
peculiarity by an artificial flattening of the forehead.<a id="FNanchor_1563_1563" href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a> In
Tahiti, Samoa, and other islands of the Pacific Ocean, it has
been customary from time immemorial to flatten the occiputs
and to press the noses of the infants, as Professor Gerland
observes, in order to increase a national characteristic which
is considered beautiful.<a id="FNanchor_1564_1564" href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a> The same practice occurs in Sumatra,
and Marsden could learn no other reason for it, but that it
was an improvement of beauty in the estimation of the
natives.<a id="FNanchor_1565_1565" href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> Among the Ovambo of South Africa, the fashion
is quite different:—“With the exception of the crown, which
is always left untouched,” says Andersson, “the men often
shave the head, which has the effect of magnifying the natural
prominence of the hinder parts of it.”<a id="FNanchor_1566_1566" href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a> Among the Chinese,
small feet are considered a woman’s chief attraction; hence
the feet of girls are pressed from early childhood. Now we
know from the measurements made by Scherzer and Schwarz,
that Chinese women have by nature unusually small feet—a
peculiarity which has always distinguished them from their
Tartar neighbours. And, as a matter of fact, the Manchu
Tartars, who at present rule the Chinese Empire, never press
the feet of their daughters.<a id="FNanchor_1567_1567" href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a></p>

<p>Each race considers its own colour preferable to every
other. The North American Indians admire “a tawny hide,”
and the Chinese dislike the white skin of the Europeans.<a id="FNanchor_1568_1568" href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a>
Some young New Zealanders, who themselves were lightly
copper-coloured, were greatly amused at the dark tint of an
Australian, and laughed at him for being so ugly.<a id="FNanchor_1569_1569" href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a> Barrington
tells us on the other hand, of an Australian woman, who,
having had a child by a white man, smoked it and rubbed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
with oil to give it a darker colour.<a id="FNanchor_1570_1570" href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a> The Hovas, who are probably,
as a rule, the lightest people in Madagascar, often put
a spot of dark colour on the cheeks, in order to heighten the
effect of their fair complexion, of which they are very proud.<a id="FNanchor_1571_1571" href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a>
Among the Malays, according to Mr. Crawfurd, “the standard
of perfection in colour is virgin gold, and, as a European
lover compares the bosom of his mistress to the whiteness of
snow, the East Insular lover compares that of his to the
yellowness of the precious metal.”<a id="FNanchor_1572_1572" href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a></p>

<p>The object of the painting of the body, so commonly
practised among savages, seems sometimes to be to exaggerate
the natural colour of the skin. Von Humboldt believes that
this is the reason why the American Indians paint themselves
with red ochre and earth.<a id="FNanchor_1573_1573" href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> The natives of Tana, who
have the colour of an old copper coin, usually dye their
bodies a few shades darker;<a id="FNanchor_1574_1574" href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a> whilst the Bornabi Islanders,
who have a light copper-coloured complexion, “anoint their
bodies with turmeric, in order to give themselves a whiter
appearance.”<a id="FNanchor_1575_1575" href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a> The Javanese, when in full dress, smear themselves
with a yellow cosmetic.<a id="FNanchor_1576_1576" href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a> And, speaking of the people
of a place in Maabar (Coromandel Coast), Marco Polo says,
“The children that are born here are black enough, but the
blacker they be the more they are thought of; wherefore from
the day of their birth their parents do rub them every week
with oil of sesamé, so that they become as black as devils.
Moreover, they make their gods black and their devils white,
and the images of their saints they do paint black all over.”<a id="FNanchor_1577_1577" href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a></p>

<p>The question,—What characteristics of the human form are
deemed beautiful? may now be answered. Men find beauty
in the full development of the visible characteristics belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
to the human organism in general; of those peculiar to the
sex; of those peculiar to the race. We have next to consider
the connection of love and beauty.</p>

<p>That this connection does not depend upon the æsthetic
pleasure excited by beauty is obvious from the fact that the
intrinsic character of an æsthetic feeling is disinterestedness,
whereas the intrinsic character of love is the very reverse. So
far as beauty implies the full development of characteristics
essential to the human organism, or to either of the sexes, the
preference given to it follows from the instinctive inclination
to healthiness, already mentioned, and needs no further discussion.
The question is to explain the stimulating influence
of racial perfection.</p>

<p>“In barbarous nations,” says v. Humboldt, “there is a
physiognomy peculiar to the tribe or horde rather than to
any individual. When we compare our domestic animals with
those which inhabit our forests, we make the same observation.”<a id="FNanchor_1578_1578" href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a>
The accuracy of this statement has been confirmed
by later writers;<a id="FNanchor_1579_1579" href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a> and we may say with M. Godron, “C’est
—aujourd’hui un fait parfaitement acquis à la science, que plus
un peuple se rapproche de l’état de nature, plus les hommes
qui le composent se ressemblent entre eux.”<a id="FNanchor_1580_1580" href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> This likeness
does not refer to the physiognomy only, but to the body as a
whole. The variations of stature, for instance, are known to
be least considerable among the peoples least advanced in
civilization.<a id="FNanchor_1581_1581" href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that this greater similarity is due
partly to the greater uniformity of the conditions of life to
which uncivilized peoples are subject. According to Villermé
and Quetelet, an inequality of stature is observed not only
between the inhabitants of towns on the one hand and those
of the country on the other, but also, in the interior of
towns, between individuals of different professions.<a id="FNanchor_1582_1582" href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a> There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
is, however, another factor, which is, I think, of still greater
importance.</p>

<p>The deviations from the national type, which occur sporadically,
have been considered the result of disease, and can,
as Professor Waitz observes, “but rarely become permanent,
as the national type is always that which harmonizes with the
soil and the climate, and the external relations in which the
respective peoples live.”<a id="FNanchor_1583_1583" href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> We must assume that a certain
kind of constitution is best suited for certain conditions of
life, and that every considerable deviation from this must
perish in the struggle for existence in a state in which natural
selection is constantly at work and physical qualities are of
the first importance. We know from Isidore Geoffroy’s investigations
that persons who deviate much, with regard to
the length of body, from the common standard—they may be
dwarfs or giants—are, as a rule, abnormal in other respects
also, being deficient in intelligence as well as in the power
of reproduction, and being especially liable to premature
death.<a id="FNanchor_1584_1584" href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> Sir W. Lawrence, too, remarks that the strength of
men who have considerably exceeded the ordinary standard
has by no means corresponded to their size, and that “there
are very few instances of what we can deem healthy, well-made
men, with all the proper attributes of the race, much
below the general standard.”<a id="FNanchor_1585_1585" href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> If, among civilized peoples,
such deviations indicate some disturbance of the vital functions,
and, as a consequence, are unfavourable to existence,
this must be even more the case with savage tribes, all the
members of which are subject to nearly the same conditions
of life. Abnormal characteristics may sometimes flourish in
a highly civilized society, but they are doomed to perish in
communities among whom the struggle for existence is far
more severe.</p>

<p>It may at first sight seem strange that all the characteristics,
however slight, in which the various races of men differ
from each other, should harmonize with particular conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
of life to the exclusion of others. But it must be remembered
that, if we had fuller knowledge, characteristics which seem to
us useless, or even hurtful, might be seen to be useful. We
know the utility of <i>some</i> special characteristics, and that of
others may, at least provisionally, be assumed. It is certain
that the physiological functions of most persons who quit
their native land and settle in a wholly different region, must
undergo a considerable change if the new conditions are not
to have injurious effects. Moreover, many bodily structures
are so intimately related, that when one part varies others
vary also, though, in most instances, we are quite unable to
assign any reason why this should be the case.</p>

<p>Savage men are generally distinguished for relatively large
jaws, which, no doubt, are of use in a state of nature, where
food is often hard and tough, where the jaws have to perform
the functions of knife and fork, and where the teeth
occasionally serve as implements. This racial peculiarity,
being in fact only a mark of low civilization, is thus easily
accounted for by the law of natural selection. The less man,
with advancing civilization, was in want of large and strong
jaws, the greater was the chance for individuals born with
smaller jaws to survive; hence a race with comparatively
small jaws gradually arose. Indeed, Professor Virchow has
shown that the prognathous type of face is inconsistent with
the full development of the brain.<a id="FNanchor_1586_1586" href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a></p>

<p>Another peculiarity which characterizes the lower races of
men is the lateral jutting-out of the cheek-bones. But, as
Mr. Spencer observes, this excessive size of the cheek-bones
is only an accompaniment of large jaws. Other peculiarities
of feature—depression of the bridge of the nose, forward
opening of the nostrils, wide-spread <i>alæ</i>, and a long and large
mouth—constantly coexist with large and protuberant jaws
and great cheek-bones, alike in uncivilized races and in the
young of civilized races;<a id="FNanchor_1587_1587" href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> hence we cannot believe that the
connection is merely accidental.</p>

<p>Professor Schaaffhausen has noticed that many peculiarities
of the skull are coincident with arrested cerebral development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
and correlated to each other:—“The characters observed in
the skulls of the lower races, namely, a narrow and low frontal
bone, a short sagittal suture, a low temporal squama, a short
occipital squama, the upper margin of which forms a flat arch,
are therefore to be considered as approximations to the
animal form, and they stand to each other in organic connection.”<a id="FNanchor_1588_1588" href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a>
It seems as if stature and muscular force were
in some way connected with the dolichocephalic and the
brachycephalic forms of the skull, for Welcker found that
short men and short races incline more to the latter, tall men
and tall races to the former. Again, according to Fick, the
muscles exercise a remarkable influence on the form of the
bones in general, and particularly upon some cranial bones.<a id="FNanchor_1589_1589" href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a></p>

<p>The process of acclimatization affords opportunities for
the study of the connection between organic structures and
functions on the one hand, and surrounding nature on the
other. At present, however, our knowledge of the subject is
exceedingly scanty. It has been asserted that the curly hair
of the European becomes straight in America,—like the hair
of an Indian; that in North America, as in New South Wales,
children of European parents are apt to become tall and lean,
whilst there is a tendency among European colonists at the
Cape to grow fat,—which reminds us of the steatopygy of the
native women.<a id="FNanchor_1590_1590" href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> Almost all that we know with certainty is
that, in the process of acclimatization, man has to undergo a
change, and that this change is often too great to be endurable.
As Dr. Felkin observes, Europeans are almost incapable of forming
colonies in the tropics;<a id="FNanchor_1591_1591" href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a> and, with few exceptions, they have
been unable to rear a sound progeny there in marriage with
white women.<a id="FNanchor_1592_1592" href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a> Colonel Hadden, who has spent sixteen years
in India, informs me that it is a prevalent opinion among
British officers in that country that an English regiment of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
thousand men would, within thirteen years, from climate, disease,
or other casualties, almost wholly die out. This statement
well agrees with Professor Sprenger’s, that a regiment consisting
of eight hundred men loses within ten years more than
seven hundred.<a id="FNanchor_1593_1593" href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> It is also, according to Colonel Hadden, a
common report that, of a third generation of pure Europeans
in India, children only are, occasionally, met with, and that
they never reach the age of puberty.<a id="FNanchor_1594_1594" href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> English parents, as a
rule, send their children to Europe when five or six years old,
as otherwise they would succumb.<a id="FNanchor_1595_1595" href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> According to Mr. Squier,
it is the concurrent testimony of all intelligent and observing
men in Central America that the pure whites are there not
only relatively but absolutely decreasing in numbers, whilst
the pure Indians are rapidly increasing, and the Ladinos more
and more approximating to the aboriginal type.<a id="FNanchor_1596_1596" href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a></p>

<p>The colour of the skin is justly considered one of the chief
characteristics of race. Now it is quite impossible to assign
any definite reason why one race is white, another black,
brown, or yellow. Nobody has yet been able to prove that
the colour of the skin is of any direct use to man, and it
certainly is not the immediate result of long exposure to a
certain climate. But we know that there exists an intimate
connection between the colour of the skin and bodily constitution.
“Les colorations diverses,” says M. Godron, “qui
distinguent les différentes variétés de l’espèce humaine,
tiennent beaucoup moins aux agents physiques, qu’aux
phénomènes les plus intimes de l’organisation qui dans l’état
actuel de la science, nous échappent et resteront peut-être
toujours couverts d’un voile impénétrable.”<a id="FNanchor_1597_1597" href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> Thus the alteration
in the customary physiological functions called acclimatization,
seems often to be connected with some change of
colour not directly depending upon the influence of the sun.
Dr. Mayer observed that a European at the tropics loses his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
rosy complexion, the difference in colour between arterial and
venous blood being strikingly diminished on account of the
smaller absorption of oxygen, which results from the feebler
process of combustion.<a id="FNanchor_1598_1598" href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> According to Dr. Tylor, it is asserted
that the pure negro in the United States has undergone
a change which has left him a shade lighter in complexion;<a id="FNanchor_1599_1599" href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a>
whilst a long medical experience at New Orleans showed
Dr. Visinié that the blood of the American negro has lost the
excess of plasticity which it possessed in Africa.<a id="FNanchor_1600_1600" href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a> A negro boy
brought to Germany by Gerhard Rohlfs, changed his colour
after a residence of two years, from deep black to light brown.<a id="FNanchor_1601_1601" href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a>
Klinkosch mentions the case of a negro who lost his blackness
and became yellow; and Caldani declares that a negro,
who was a shoemaker at Venice, was black when brought,
during infancy, to that city, but became gradually lighter, and
had the hue of a person suffering from a slight jaundice.<a id="FNanchor_1602_1602" href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a> In the
‘Philosophical Transactions,’ there is even a record of a negro
who became as white as a European.<a id="FNanchor_1603_1603" href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> On the other hand,
we are told of an English gentleman Macnaughten by name,
who long lived the life of a native in the jungle of Southern
India, and acquired, even on the clothed portions of his body, a
skin as brown as that of a Brahman.<a id="FNanchor_1604_1604" href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> These statements, if true,
certainly refer to exceedingly exceptional cases, but their
accuracy cannot be <i>à priori</i> denied. We know that certain
organisms are much better able than others to undergo the
change which constitutes acclimatization, and we have no
positive reason to doubt that this power may, in abnormal
cases, be extraordinarily great. At any rate, it is beyond doubt
that a close connection exists between the colour of the skin
and the physiological functions of the body, on the one hand,
and between these and the conditions of life on the other.
Disease is commonly accompanied by a change of colour.
Mr. Wallace observes that, in many islands of the Malay
Archipelago, species of widely different genera of butterflies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
differ in precisely the same way as to colour or form from
allied species in other islands.<a id="FNanchor_1605_1605" href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a> The same thing occurs to a
less degree in other parts of the world also. And Agassiz has
pointed out that, in Asia and Africa, the large apes and the
human races have the same colour of the skin.<a id="FNanchor_1606_1606" href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a></p>

<p>We may thus take for granted that racial peculiarities
stand in some connection with the external circumstances in
which the various races live. It may perhaps be objected
that we meet with native tribes of various types on the same
degree of latitude, and under the same climatic conditions.<a id="FNanchor_1607_1607" href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a>
But we must remember that it is often impossible to decide
whether the conditions of life are exactly the same; that
intermixture of blood has caused a great confusion of racial
types; and that all peoples have arrived at their present
localities after more or less extensive migrations. We may
be sure that some characters have been preserved from
earlier times when the race lived in other circumstances, and
that the higher its degree of civilization the less likely it
would be to lose the stamp impressed upon it.<a id="FNanchor_1608_1608" href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a></p>

<p>It is, however, exceedingly doubtful whether racial differences
are so directly the result of external influences as anthropologists
generally believe,—that is, whether they are
the inherited effects of conditions of life to which previous
generations have been subject. Professor Weismann, as is
well known, thinks that acquired characters are not transmitted
from parent to offspring. “It has never been proved,”
he says, “that acquired characters are transmitted, and it has
never been demonstrated that, without the aid of such transmission,
the evolution of the organic world becomes unintelligible.”<a id="FNanchor_1609_1609" href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a>
Man has from time immemorial mutilated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
his body in various ways, and there is not a single well-founded
case of these mutilations having been inherited by
the offspring.<a id="FNanchor_1610_1610" href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a> The children of accomplished pianists do
not inherit the art of playing the piano. Facts show that
children of highly civilized nations have no trace of a language,
when they have grown up in a wild condition and in complete
isolation.<a id="FNanchor_1611_1611" href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a> Change in colour influenced by sun and air is
obviously temporary. The children of the husbandman, or
of the sailor, are just as fair as those of the most delicate and
pale inhabitant of a city; and, although the Moors, who have
lived in Africa since the seventh century, are generally in
mature life very sunburnt, their children are as white as those
born in Europe, and “restent blancs toute leur vie, quand leurs
travaux ne les exposent pas aux ardeurs du soleil.”<a id="FNanchor_1612_1612" href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a></p>

<p>Such facts are certainly not in favour of the prevalent
theory that the differences of race are due to direct adaptation.
Whether Professor Weismann’s theory proves to be
well founded or not, we manifestly cannot assume that the
heredity of acquired characters suffices to explain the origin
of the human races. It seems most probable that, at the very
earliest stages of human evolution, mankind was restricted to a
comparatively small area, and was then homogeneous, as every
animal and vegetable species is under similar conditions. In
the struggle for existence the intellectual faculties of man
were developed, and before the breaking away of isolated
groups he may have invented the art of making fire, and
of fabricating the simplest implements and weapons. This
mental superiority made it possible for man to disperse, enabling
him to exist even under conditions somewhat different
from those to which he was originally adapted. His organism
had to undergo certain changes, but we are not aware that these
modifications were transmitted to descendants. All that we
know is, that the children born were not exactly like each
other, and that those who happened to vary most in accordance
with the new conditions of life as a rule survived, and
became the ancestors of following generations. The con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>genital
characters which enabled them to survive were of
course transmitted to their offspring, and thus, through natural
selection,<a id="FNanchor_1613_1613" href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a> races would gradually arise, the members of each
of which would have as hereditary dispositions the same
peculiarities as those which, to a certain extent, may be
acquired through acclimatization, but then only for the
individual himself, not for his descendants. We can thus
understand how the children of a negro are black<a id="FNanchor_1614_1614" href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a>—even if
they are born in Europe<a id="FNanchor_1615_1615" href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a>—as the black colour is the correlative
of certain physiological processes favourable to existence
in the country of their race. They survive, whilst the children
of Europeans who have emigrated to the tropics are carried
off in great numbers, even though their parents have succeeded
in undergoing the functional modifications which accompanied
the change of abode.</p>

<p>This explanation of racial differences seems the more
acceptable, when we take into consideration the immense
period which has elapsed since man began to spread over the
earth, and the slow and gradual change of abodes. He was
not at once moved from the tropics to the polar zones, or
from the polar zones to the tropics, but had to undergo an
indefinitely long chain of adaptive processes. Thus were
gradually established such radical differences as those which
distinguish a European from a negro, an Australian from
a Red-skin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now found an answer to our question, why man,
in the choice of mate, gives the preference to the best representatives
of his race. The full development of racial characters
indicates health, a deviation from them indicates disease.
Physical beauty is thus in every respect the outward manifes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>tation
of physical perfection, or healthiness, and the development
of the instinct which prefers beauty to ugliness is evidently
within the power of natural selection.</p>

<p>This explanation of the connection between love and beauty,
as also of the origin of the races of men, is very different from
that given by Mr. Darwin. “The men of each race,” he says,
“prefer what they are accustomed to; they cannot endure any
great change; but they like variety, and admire each characteristic
carried to a moderate extreme.... As the great
anatomist Bichat long ago said, if every one were cast in the
same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty. If all
our women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de’
Medici, we should for a time be charmed; but we should soon
wish for variety, and as soon as we had obtained variety, we
should wish to see certain characters a little exaggerated
beyond the then existing common standard.”<a id="FNanchor_1616_1616" href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a></p>

<p>In the fashions of our own dress, says Mr. Darwin, we
see exactly the same principle and the same desire to carry
every point to an extreme.<a id="FNanchor_1617_1617" href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> Man prefers, to a certain extent,
what he is accustomed to see. Thus the Maoris, who are in
the habit of dyeing their lips blue, consider it “a reproach to
a woman to have red lips;”<a id="FNanchor_1618_1618" href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> and we ourselves dislike, on the
whole, any great deviation from the leading fashions. But,
on the other hand, man wants variety. Now in one, now in
another way, he changes his dress in order to attract attention,
or to charm. The fashions of savages are certainly more permanent
than ours;<a id="FNanchor_1619_1619" href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> but the extreme diversity of ornaments
with which many uncivilized peoples bedeck themselves, shows
their emulation to make themselves attractive by means of new
enticements. “Each of the Outanatas (New Guinea),” says
Mr. Earl, “seemed desirous of ornamenting himself in some
way different from his neighbour;”<a id="FNanchor_1620_1620" href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a> and, with regard to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Pacific Islanders, Mr. John Williams remarks that “the inhabitants
of almost every group ... have their peculiar ideas
as to what constitutes an addition to beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_1621_1621" href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> But it is
impossible to believe that the different races’ ideal of personal
beauty are in any way connected with this capriciousness of
taste. Were this the case, as Mr. Darwin suggests, the men
of each race would admire variations and piquant peculiarities
in the appearance of their women, and not only each
<i>characteristic</i> point “carried to a moderate extreme.”</p>

<p>According to Mr. Darwin, racial differences are due to the
different standards of beauty, whereas, according to the theory
here indicated, the different standards of beauty are due to
racial differences. “Let us suppose,” says Mr. Darwin, “the
members of a tribe, practising some form of marriage, to
spread over an unoccupied continent, they would soon split
up into distinct hordes, separated from each other by various
barriers, and still more effectually by the incessant wars
between all barbarous nations. The hordes would thus be
exposed to slightly different conditions and habits of life, and
would sooner or later come to differ in some small degree. As
soon as this occurred, each isolated tribe would form for itself a
slightly different standard of beauty; and then unconscious
selection would come into action through the more powerful
and leading men preferring certain women to others. Thus
the differences between the tribes, at first very slight, would
gradually and inevitably be more or less increased.”<a id="FNanchor_1622_1622" href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> This
theory—that racial differences are due to sexual selection—obviously
presupposes either that the human organism is
alike well fitted to any climate and natural conditions; or
that no correlation exists between the visible parts of the
body and its functions. Otherwise, of course, little effect
could be produced through the preference given to certain
individuals; for in a savage state, where celibacy is
an exception, those men and women whose constitution was
best suited to the conditions of life would, in any case, in
the end, determine the racial type. It is also difficult to see
how those slight variations from the original human type,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
which, according to Mr. Darwin, characterized the distinct
hordes or tribes into which mankind was split up, could have
developed into such enormous differences as we find in the
colour of the skin of, for example, a negro and a European—only
through the selection of the best representatives of these
tribal peculiarities, these slight variations. Finally, it seems
doubtful whether Mr. Darwin would have ascribed racial
differences in colour to the influence of sexual selection, had
he considered the important fact, already mentioned, that the
larger apes have the same colour of the skin as the human
races living in the same country.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin also thinks that the differences in external
appearance between man and the lower animals are, to a
certain extent, due to sexual selection. The chief character
of the human race which he proposes to account for in this
way is the general hairlessness of the body. “No one supposes,”
he says, “that the nakedness of the skin is any direct
advantage to man; his body therefore cannot have been
divested of hair through natural selection.”<a id="FNanchor_1623_1623" href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> It is curious
that the hairlessness of man has puzzled so many anthropologists,<a id="FNanchor_1624_1624" href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a>
as it may very easily be explained by the law of
variation. When man had invented the art of making fire,
and the idea of covering himself to secure protection from
cold had occurred to his mind, hairlessness was no serious
disadvantage in the struggle for existence. Hence natural
selection ceased to operate in the matter, and a hairless race
gradually arose. We find the same principle at work in
various other ways. Civilized man does not need such keen
vision as savages;<a id="FNanchor_1625_1625" href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a> consequently many of us are short-sighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
and few Europeans could match a Red Indian in his power
of detecting the symptoms of a trail. For the same reason
we are generally inferior to savages in the capacity for discriminating
odours, and our teeth are apt to be very much
less sound and vigorous than theirs.</p>

<p>That sexual selection has had <i>some</i> influence on the physical
aspect of mankind is probable. Accurate observers in
different parts of the world have remarked that personal
deformities are very rare in savage races unaffected by
European influence.<a id="FNanchor_1626_1626" href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> This chiefly depends upon the fact
that deformed individuals seldom survive the hardships of
early life, but, as Sir W. Lawrence says, if they do survive,
they are prevented by the kind of aversion they inspire from
propagating their deformities.<a id="FNanchor_1627_1627" href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> It is not unlikely that the
selection of the best representatives of the race contributes
to keep the racial type pure. Sexual selection, too, may be
the cause why, among savages, the men are so often handsomer
than the women—that is, better specimens of their sex
and their race;<a id="FNanchor_1628_1628" href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> whilst, in civilized society, the reverse is
true. We have seen that savage women have great liberty of
disposing of their own hand, and that, at lower stages of
civilization, celibacy occurs almost exclusively among the
men. Among us, on the contrary, the unmarried women outnumber
the unmarried men, and, whilst a man’s ability to
marry depends only to a small extent upon his personal
appearance, the like may certainly not be said of women.</p>

<small>THE LAW OF SIMILARITY</small></h2>


<p>A powerful instinct keeps animals from pairing with individuals
belonging to another species than their own.
“L’animal,” says M. Duvernoy, “a l’instinct de se rapprocher
de son espèce et de s’éloigner des autres, comme il a celui de
choisir ses aliments et d’éviter les poisons.”<a id="FNanchor_1629_1629" href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a> Among Birds,
there are found a small number of wild hybrids, nearly all of
which are in the order of Gallinae, and most of which belong
to the genus Tetrao.<a id="FNanchor_1630_1630" href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> But among Insects, Fishes, and Mammals,
living in a state of nature, hybridism is unknown or
almost so.<a id="FNanchor_1631_1631" href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> And, even among domesticated mammals,
some tricks are often required to deceive the male, and so to
conquer its aversion to a female of a different species. The
stallion, for instance, who is to cover a she-ass, is frequently
first excited by the presence of a mare, for which, at the proper
moment, the she-ass is substituted.<a id="FNanchor_1632_1632" href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a></p>

<p>We may be sure that, were it not for this instinctive feeling,
many more animal hybrids would be naturally produced than
is the case. In the vegetable kingdom, where the play of
instincts is altogether out of the question, bastards occur much
more frequently;<a id="FNanchor_1633_1633" href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> and in captivity a considerable number of
animal hybrid forms are produced that are never met with in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
a state of nature.<a id="FNanchor_1634_1634" href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> Yet, according to Mr. Darwin, there are
good grounds for the doctrine of Pallas, that the conditions to
which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been
subjected, generally eliminate the tendency towards mutual
sterility, so that the domesticated descendants of species
which in their natural state would have been in some degree
sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile.<a id="FNanchor_1635_1635" href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a></p>

<p>The origin of this instinct, which helps to keep even closely
allied species in a state of nature distinct, seems to be sufficiently
clear. The number of species which have proved
fertile together are very limited, and the fertility of the
hybrid offspring is almost constantly diminished, often even
to a very great extent. Of course, no one now talks of the
sterility of hybrids as a moral necessity—hybrids being
<i>animalia adulterina</i>,—or as the result of a special divine
decree, that new species should not be multiplied indefinitely.<a id="FNanchor_1636_1636" href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a>
M. Isidore Geoffroy has shown not only that hybrids may be
fertile, but that “infertile” hybrids are, properly speaking,
merely the hybrids which are most rarely fertile, their sterility
never being absolute.<a id="FNanchor_1637_1637" href="#Footnote_1637_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> Moreover, as has been pointed out by
Mr. Wallace, in almost all the experiments that have hitherto
been made in crossing distinct species, no care has been taken
to avoid close interbreeding; hence these experiments cannot
be held to prove that hybrids are in all cases infertile <i>inter se</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1638_1638" href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a>
But looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing
of plants and animals, we may with Mr. Darwin conclude
that some degree of sterility in hybrids is an extremely
general result.<a id="FNanchor_1639_1639" href="#Footnote_1639_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> This being the case with the hybrids of our
domesticated animals, it must be so all the more with animals
in a state of nature, which generally live under conditions
less favourable to mutual fertility. It is easy to understand,
then, that instincts leading to intercrossing of different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
species, even if appearing occasionally, never could be long-lived,
as only those animals which preferred pairing with individuals
of their own species, gave birth to an offspring
endowed with a normal power of reproduction, and thus
became the founders of numerous generations that inherited
their instincts.</p>

<p>The relative or absolute sterility characterizing first crosses
and hybrids depends upon a biological law which might be
called the “Law of Similarity.” The degree of sterility, in
either case,<a id="FNanchor_1640_1640" href="#Footnote_1640_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a> runs, at least to a certain extent, parallel with
the general affinity of the forms that are united. Thus, most
animal hybrids are produced by individuals belonging to the
same genus, whilst species belonging to distinct genera can
rarely, and those belonging to distinct families perhaps never,
be crossed.<a id="FNanchor_1641_1641" href="#Footnote_1641_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> The parallelism, however, is not complete, for
a multitude of closely allied species will not unite, or unite
only with great difficulty, though other species, widely different
from each other, can be crossed with facility. Hence Mr.
Darwin infers that the difficulty or facility in crossing “apparently
depends exclusively on the sexual constitution of
the species which are crossed, or on their sexual elective
affinity, <i>i.e.</i>, the ‘Wahlverwandtschaft’ of Gärtner.” But as
species rarely, or never, become modified in one character,
without being at the same time modified in many, and as
systematic affinity includes all visible resemblances and dissimilarities,
any difference in sexual constitution between two
species would naturally stand in more or less close relation
with their systematic position.<a id="FNanchor_1642_1642" href="#Footnote_1642_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a></p>

<p>With regard to the instinct in question, man follows the
general rule in the animal kingdom. Our notions of morality
are closely connected with the instinctive feelings engraved in
our nature; and bestiality is commonly looked upon as one of
the most heinous crimes of which man can make himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
guilty. Several passages both in ancient<a id="FNanchor_1643_1643" href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> and modern writers<a id="FNanchor_1644_1644" href="#Footnote_1644_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a>
prove the occasional occurrence of this crime, but always
under circumstances analogous to those under which single
birds sometimes form connections against nature,<a id="FNanchor_1645_1645" href="#Footnote_1645_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a> <i>i.e.</i>,
either because of isolation, or on account of vitiated instincts.<a id="FNanchor_1646_1646" href="#Footnote_1646_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Supporters of the hypothesis that the several races of man
are distinct species of the genus Homo, assert that an instinctive
aversion similar to that which keeps different animal
species from intermingling, exists also between the various
human races.<a id="FNanchor_1647_1647" href="#Footnote_1647_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> It may be noted by the way that, even if this
were true, the idea that mankind consists of various species
might be controverted; for certain races of domestic or semi-domesticated
animals seem to prefer breeding with their own
kind and refuse to mingle with others. Thus Mr. Bennett
states that the dark and pale coloured herds of fallow deer,
which have long been kept together in the Forest of Dean
and two other places, have never been known to mingle. On
one of the Faroe Islands, the half-wild native black sheep
are said not to have readily mixed with the imported white
sheep. And in Circassia, where six sub-races of the horse
are known and have received distinct names, horses of three
of these races, whilst living a free life, almost always refuse
to mingle and cross, and will even attack each other.<a id="FNanchor_1648_1648" href="#Footnote_1648_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a> As
for man, there are many races who dislike marrying persons
of another race, but the motives are various. The different
ideas of beauty no doubt play an important part. Mr. Win<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>woode
Reade does not think it probable that negroes would
prefer even the most beautiful European woman, on the mere
grounds of physical admiration, to a good-looking negress.<a id="FNanchor_1649_1649" href="#Footnote_1649_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a>
A civilized race does not readily intermingle with one less
advanced in civilization, from the same motives as those
which prevent a lord from marrying a peasant girl. And
more than anything else, I think, the enmity, or at least, want
of sympathy, due to difference of interests, ideas, and habits,
which so often exist between distinct peoples or tribes, helps
to keep races separate. But such reasons as these have nothing
in common with the instinctive feeling which deters animals of
distinct species from pairing with each other. Hence, when
two races come into very close mutual contact, especially if
they are at about the same stage of civilization, their dislike
to intermarriage commonly disappears.</p>

<p>Mongrels form, indeed, a large proportion of the inhabitants
of the world. It is doubtful whether there are any pure races
in Europe; not even the Basques can pretend to purity of
blood.<a id="FNanchor_1650_1650" href="#Footnote_1650_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> M. Broca found, when investigating the subject of
stature, that nineteen-twentieths of the whole population
of France presented, in various degrees, the characters of
mixed races.<a id="FNanchor_1651_1651" href="#Footnote_1651_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> In North America, different races intermingle
more and more every day. In Greenland, according
to Dr. Nansen, in the course of a century and a half there has
been such an intermixture of races that it would now be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to find a true Eskimo
throughout the whole of the west coast; and the Europeans,
far from being disliked by the native women have succeeded
in inspiring them with so much respect that the “simplest
European sailor is preferred to the best Eskimo seal catcher.”<a id="FNanchor_1652_1652" href="#Footnote_1652_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a>
In Mexico, the Spanish mixed breeds constitute two-thirds or
three-fourths of the whole population;<a id="FNanchor_1653_1653" href="#Footnote_1653_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a> and South America,
to quote a French writer, is “le grand laboratoire des nations
hybrides ou métisses modernes.”<a id="FNanchor_1654_1654" href="#Footnote_1654_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a> Of twelve millions of
mongrels, which is the estimated number of mongrels on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
face of the globe, no fewer than eleven millions are found there.<a id="FNanchor_1655_1655" href="#Footnote_1655_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a>
Even in remote Tierra del Fuego, according to Mr. Bridges,
some mongrels of European fathers and indigenous mothers
have appeared during the last few years.</p>

<p>In Asia there are numberless instances of intermixture of
breed between the Tartars, Mongols, and Tunguses, and the
Russians and Chinese, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_1656_1656" href="#Footnote_1656_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a> In India there are many
Eurasians; in the Indian Archipelago Chinese and Malays
intermarry;<a id="FNanchor_1657_1657" href="#Footnote_1657_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a> and, in the Islands of the South Sea, the mongrels
of European fathers amount to a considerable number. In
Africa, the eastern Soudan is a great centre of mixed breeds
between races much removed from one another. And, in
Southern Africa, the Griquas—the offspring of Dutch colonists
and Hottentot women—form a very distinct race.</p>

<p>As far as we know, there are no human races who, when
intermingled, are entirely sterile. But as regards the degree
of fertility of first crosses and of mongrels, the opinions of
different anthropologists vary considerably. Those who do
not believe in the unity of the human race have been especially
solicitous to prove that crosses are almost inevitably
followed by bad results in that respect. Thus Dr. Knox
thinks that the half-breeds, if they were abandoned to themselves
and no longer had access to pure races, would rapidly
disappear, the “hybrid” being rejected by nature as a degradation
of humanity.<a id="FNanchor_1658_1658" href="#Footnote_1658_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a> Dr. Nott asserts that, when two proximate
species of mankind, two races bearing a general
resemblance to each other in type, are bred together, they
produce offspring perfectly prolific; but that, when species
the most widely separated, such as the Anglo-Saxon and the
negro, are crossed, the mulatto offspring are but partially prolific,
and acquire an inherent tendency to run out, and become
eventually extinct, when kept apart from the parent stocks.<a id="FNanchor_1659_1659" href="#Footnote_1659_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a>
The same opinion is entertained by M. Broca, and by M.
Pouchet, who thinks that the crossed race will exist only if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
continues to be supported by the two creating types remaining
in the midst of it.<a id="FNanchor_1660_1660" href="#Footnote_1660_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Dr. Prichard believes it may be
asserted, without the least chance of valid contradiction, that
mankind, of all races and varieties, are equally capable of
having offspring by intermarriage, and that such connections
are equally prolific whether contracted between individuals of
the same variety or of the most dissimilar varieties. “If
there is any difference,” he says, “it is probably in favour of
the latter.”<a id="FNanchor_1661_1661" href="#Footnote_1661_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> According to M. Godron, the mongrels have
generally shown a higher degree of fertility than their parent
races;<a id="FNanchor_1662_1662" href="#Footnote_1662_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a> and M. Quatrefages asserts that mulattoes are as
fruitful as pure breeds.<a id="FNanchor_1663_1663" href="#Footnote_1663_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that so little attention has for some
time been paid to this most important question. The result
is that the effects of the intermixture of races are not much
better known now, than they were twenty or thirty years ago.
The only thing which may be considered certain is, that the
hypothesis of the depressing influence of crossing upon fertility,
as the theory has generally been propounded, involves
a great deal of exaggeration. It is chiefly owing to M.
Broca’s celebrated essay, ‘Sur l’hybridité,’ that this doctrine
has been so widely accepted. He asserts that the connections
of Europeans with Australian women have proved very
slightly prolific, and that the mongrels resulting from them
are almost sterile. “No statistical writer,” he says, “nor any
historian, enumerates cross-breeds among the Australian
population.”<a id="FNanchor_1664_1664" href="#Footnote_1664_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a> Yet, this land has for a considerable time been
inhabited by European colonists, many of whom have not
had opportunities of marrying wives of their own race. It
has also been shown that the cohabitation of whites and
native women is very common in Australia. But the number
of mongrels there is, nevertheless, exceedingly small, so
small that in the native dialects there does not exist a single
word to designate them.<a id="FNanchor_1665_1665" href="#Footnote_1665_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>Supposing that these remarkable statements referred chiefly
to the eastern and southern parts of the Australian continent, I
asked Bishop R. Salvado and the Rev. Joseph Johnston, living
in West Australia, to inform me whether, in that country, any
mixed race exists, and, if so, whether it is fruitful or not. From
the former, who has lived among the West Australian aborigines
for more than forty years, and through an excellent work on
their life and customs has gained the reputation of a first-rate
authority, I had the pleasure of receiving the following
answer, dated New Norcia, October 17, 1888:—“With regard
to the sterility of the half-caste natives, of which I had no
experience when I wrote my book, I am able now to deny it
altogether, except in cases similar to those among the
Europeans. I know several cases of husband and wife, half-caste
natives, having at present six and seven and even eight
children, and they may in time have more; and I know a
good many Europeans who, having married native women,
have several children. In fact, in the case of one of those
marriages there were six children, and in another seven, and
I could give the name of each of them.” The Rev. J. Johnston
writes, “There is a school for half-caste boys and girls at
Perth, and they seem bright and intelligent children, not
unlike Polynesian children. As they grow up, they go out to
service, and some of the youths are employed as post and
telegraph messengers.... At the New Norcia mission, there
are several half-caste families, as well as blacks, and they all
have children.” The following statement of Mr. Taplin referring
to the aborigines of the Lower Murray, goes in the
same direction:—“The pure blacks,” he says, “are not so
healthy as the half-castes. Always the children of two half-castes
will be healthier and stronger than either the children
of blacks or the children of a black and a half-caste. When
a half-caste man and woman marry, they generally have a large
and vigorous family. I could point to half a dozen such.”<a id="FNanchor_1666_1666" href="#Footnote_1666_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a></p>

<p>These statements of highly competent persons are, I think,
quite sufficient to disprove M. Broca’s hypothesis. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
show that, if a mixed race is almost wanting in certain parts
of Australia, this does not depend upon physiological conditions
of the kind suggested. It should be remembered that
the sexual intercourse of Europeans with savage women is
most commonly transitory and accidental, and frequently
takes place with prostitutes or licentious women, who are
generally known to be sterile. And, even when the white
settler takes a native’s daughter to live with him under his
own roof as a wife or a concubine, and accustoms her to a
half-civilized manner of living, her unfruitfulness<a id="FNanchor_1667_1667" href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> may be
owing to quite another cause than the mixture of blood.
Mr. Darwin has shown that changed conditions of life have
an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive
system. Thus animals, as also plants, when removed from
their natural conditions, are often rendered in some degree
infertile or completely barren, even when the conditions have
not been greatly changed. And this failure of animals to
breed under confinement cannot, at least to any considerable
extent, depend upon a failure in their sexual instincts.
“Numerous cases,” says Mr. Darwin, “have been given of
various animals which couple freely under confinement, but
never conceive; or, if they conceive and produce young, these
are fewer in number than is natural to the species.”<a id="FNanchor_1668_1668" href="#Footnote_1668_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a> It is
reasonable to suppose that savage man, when he moves into
more civilized conditions, is subject to the same law. Indeed,
statements have been reported to me, which tend to show that
the indigenous women at the Polynesian missionary stations
have become less fruitful than they were in their native state.
As to the alleged sterility of crosses between the European
and Australian races, it should be observed that the rarity of
mongrels in certain parts of Australia is more or less owing to
the natives themselves habitually destroying the half-castes.<a id="FNanchor_1669_1669" href="#Footnote_1669_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
The Rev. A. Meyer states that, in the Encounter Bay tribe,
“nearly all the children of European fathers used to be put to
death;”<a id="FNanchor_1670_1670" href="#Footnote_1670_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a> whilst, among the Narrinyeri, about one-half of the
half-caste infants fell victims to the jealousy of their mothers’
husbands.<a id="FNanchor_1671_1671" href="#Footnote_1671_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a> But with regard to the West Australian aborigines
in the neighbourhood of Fremantle, the Rev. J. Johnston
writes that he does not think it has been the custom there to
destroy the half-caste illegitimate offspring of black women,
as he never heard of such a thing,—a fact which may account
for the comparatively large number of mongrels in that part
of the continent.</p>

<p>Other statements also, adduced as evidence for the hypothesis
of M. Broca, have proved more or less untrustworthy. Thus
the alleged sterility of the mulattoes of Jamaica<a id="FNanchor_1672_1672" href="#Footnote_1672_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a> has been
disputed by other writers.<a id="FNanchor_1673_1673" href="#Footnote_1673_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> So also v. Görtz’s statement
that the children of the Dutch and Malay women in Java
(Lipplapps) are only productive to the third generation,<a id="FNanchor_1674_1674" href="#Footnote_1674_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> has
been called in question.<a id="FNanchor_1675_1675" href="#Footnote_1675_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a></p>

<p>Yet, although we may consider it certain that the diversities
even between the races which least resemble each other are
not so great but that, under favourable conditions, a mixed
race may easily be produced, I do not deny the possibility of
crossing being, to a certain extent, unfavourable to fertility.
The statements as to the rapid increase of some mixed races
do not prove the reverse. For the bad result of crossing
would not necessarily appear at once; and a drop of pure
blood would be sufficient to increase fertility, just as, when a
hybrid is crossed with either pure parent species, sterility is
usually much lessened.<a id="FNanchor_1676_1676" href="#Footnote_1676_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> It is a remarkable fact that mixed
marriages between Jews and persons of other races are comparatively
infertile. In Prussia, these marriages have been separately
registered since 1875, and between that year and 1881 there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
was an average of 1·63 to a marriage, whereas, during the
same period, pure Jewish marriages resulted in an average of
4·41 children or very nearly three times as many. In Bavaria,
between 1876 and 1880, the numbers were only 1·1 per marriage
against 4·7 children to purely Jewish marriages. And
this conspicuous infertility implies greater sterility. Among
fifty-six such marriages, with regard to which Mr. Jacobs
ascertained the results, no fewer than nine were sterile, <i>i.e.</i>, 18
per cent.,—a striking contrast to the number of sterile marriages
which he found in seventy-one marriages between Jewish
cousins, where the percentage of sterility was only 5·4 per
cent.<a id="FNanchor_1677_1677" href="#Footnote_1677_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a> Mr. Jacobs, however, informs me that it has been
suggested that this infertility may be due rather to the higher
age at which such marriages are likely to take place. There
is still a strong feeling against them among Jews, which is
only likely to be overcome after independence of thought and
position has been reached. At the same time Mr. Jacobs
does not consider this sufficient to account for the very great
discrepancy. But we must not, of course, take for granted
that the crossing of any two races has the same effects as the
crossing of Jewish and non-Jewish Europeans seems to have.</p>

<p>Even if it could be proved, however, that mixture of races
produces lessened fertility of first crosses and of mongrels,
this would not make it necessary for us to reject the doctrine
of the unity of mankind. It is true that the domesticated
varieties both of animals and of plants, when crossed, are as
a general rule prolific, in some cases even more so than the
purely bred parent varieties; whereas species, when crossed, and
their hybrid offspring, are almost invariably in some degree
sterile. But this rule is not altogether without exceptions.
Even Agassiz condemned the employment of fertility of union
as a limiting principle. He considered this a fallacy, “or at
least a <i>petitio principii</i>, not admissible in a philosophical discussion
of what truly constitutes the characteristics of species.”<a id="FNanchor_1678_1678" href="#Footnote_1678_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a>
Thus the red and yellow varieties of maize are in some degree
infertile when crossed, and the blue-and the red-flowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
forms of the pimpernel, considered by most botanists to be
the same species, as they present no differences of form or
structure, are, according to Gärtner, mutually sterile. Moreover,
Mr. Darwin’s investigations on dimorphic and trimorphic
plants have shown that the physiological test of lessened
fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe
criterion of specific distinction.<a id="FNanchor_1679_1679" href="#Footnote_1679_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> As for animals, Professor
Vogt asserts that, in the opinion of experienced breeders,
certain races can with difficulty be made to pair, and the fertility
of the mongrels soon diminishes, whilst other races pair
readily and are prolific.<a id="FNanchor_1680_1680" href="#Footnote_1680_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a> Sir J. Sebright says, “Although I
believe the occasional intermixture of different families to be
necessary, I do not, by any means, approve of mixing two
distinct breeds, with the view of uniting the valuable properties
of both: this experiment has been frequently tried by others
as well as by myself, but has, I believe, never succeeded.
The first cross frequently produces a tolerable animal, but it
is a breed that cannot be continued.”<a id="FNanchor_1681_1681" href="#Footnote_1681_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a></p>

<small>PROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KINDRED</small></h2>


<p>The horror of incest is an almost universal characteristic
of mankind, the cases which seem to indicate a perfect absence
of this feeling being so exceedingly rare that they must be
regarded merely as anomalous aberrations from a general
rule.</p>

<p>Yet the degrees of kinship within which intercourse is
forbidden, are by no means everywhere the same. It is most,
and almost universally, abominated between parents and
children, especially mother and son. As an exception to this
rule, v. Langsdorf states that, among the Kaniagmuts, not
only do brothers and sisters cohabit with each other, but even
parents and children.<a id="FNanchor_1682_1682" href="#Footnote_1682_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a> The Eastern Tinneh, or Chippewyans,
occasionally marry their mothers, sisters, or daughters, but
such alliances are not considered correct by general opinion.<a id="FNanchor_1683_1683" href="#Footnote_1683_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a>
In the Indian Archipelago, according to Schwaner, Wilken,
and Riedel, marriages between brothers and sisters, and
parents and children, are permitted among certain tribes;<a id="FNanchor_1684_1684" href="#Footnote_1684_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
and similar unions, it is said, took place among the ancient
Persians.<a id="FNanchor_1685_1685" href="#Footnote_1685_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> Again, in Nukahiva, as we are told by Lisiansky,
although near kinsfolk are forbidden to intermarry, it sometimes
happens that a father lives with his daughter, and a
brother with his sister; but on one occasion it was looked
upon as a horrible crime when a mother cohabited with her
son.<a id="FNanchor_1686_1686" href="#Footnote_1686_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> Among the Kukis, as described by Rennel, marriages
were generally contracted without regard to blood-relationship;
only a mother might not wed her child.<a id="FNanchor_1687_1687" href="#Footnote_1687_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a> Among the
Karens of Tenasserim, “matrimonial alliances between brother
and sister, or father and daughter, are not uncommon.”<a id="FNanchor_1688_1688" href="#Footnote_1688_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a>
Speaking of the King of the Warua, Mr. Cameron states
that in his harem are to be found his stepmothers, aunts,
sisters, nieces, cousins, as also his own daughters.<a id="FNanchor_1689_1689" href="#Footnote_1689_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a> Among
the Wanyoro, brothers may marry their sisters, and even
fathers their daughters; but a son does not marry his own
mother, although the other widows of his father become his
property.<a id="FNanchor_1690_1690" href="#Footnote_1690_1690" class="fnanchor">1690</a></p>

<p>Unions between brothers and sisters, who are children of
the same mother as well as the same father, are likewise held
in general abhorrence. The primitive feeling against such
connections is strongly expressed in the Finnish Kullervo
Myth. The unfortunate Kullervo, after discovering that he
had committed incest with his sister, wails—</p>

<p>The Californian Nishinam believe that, for the prevention of
incest, at the beginning of the world, not one but two pairs
were created from whom sprang all the Nishinam.<a id="FNanchor_1692_1692" href="#Footnote_1692_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> When
the missionary Jellinghaus once asked some Munda Kols
whether animals knew what is right and wrong, the answer was,
“No, because they do not know mother, sister, and daughter.”<a id="FNanchor_1693_1693" href="#Footnote_1693_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a>
Yet, as we have seen, there are exceptions to the rule; and
certain peoples who consider intercourse between parents and
children incestuous, allow unions between brothers and sisters.
Among the Kamchadales, says Krasheninnikoff, “marriage is
forbidden only between father and daughter, mother and son.”<a id="FNanchor_1694_1694" href="#Footnote_1694_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a>
Not long ago, the wild Veddahs of Ceylon regarded the
marriage of a man with his younger sister as not only proper
and natural, but, in fact, as <i>the</i> proper marriage, though
marriage with an elder sister or aunt would have been as
incestuous and revolting to them as to us.<a id="FNanchor_1695_1695" href="#Footnote_1695_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a> Among the
Annamese, according to a missionary who has lived among
them for forty years, no girl who is twelve years old and has
a brother is a virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1696_1696" href="#Footnote_1696_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a> Liebich tells us that the Gypsies allow
a brother to marry his sister, though such marriages are generally
avoided by them.<a id="FNanchor_1697_1697" href="#Footnote_1697_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> Among the Wa-taïta, says Mr.
Thomson, “very few of the young men are able to marry for
want of the proper number of cows—a state of affairs which
not unfrequently leads to marriage with sisters, though this
practice is highly reprobated.”<a id="FNanchor_1698_1698" href="#Footnote_1698_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a> Among the aborigines of
Brazil, union with a sister, or a brother’s daughter, is
almost universally held to be infamous. Such practices
are not uncommon in small isolated hordes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> “but the
ancient Tupinambases (ancestors of the Tupis) allowed
nothing of the kind openly.”<a id="FNanchor_1699_1699" href="#Footnote_1699_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> In a song of the ‘Rig-Veda,’
Yamí appears in support of the marriage of brother and
sister, while the opposition is personified in Yama.<a id="FNanchor_1700_1700" href="#Footnote_1700_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> Buddhist
legends mention various cases of such unions;<a id="FNanchor_1701_1701" href="#Footnote_1701_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> and it is
stated in the ‘Ynglinga Saga’ that “while Niord was with the
Vans he had taken his own sister in marriage, for that he was
allowed by their law.”<a id="FNanchor_1702_1702" href="#Footnote_1702_1702" class="fnanchor">1702</a> But we have no evidence whatever
that such unions were commonly allowed by the ancient
Scandinavians. “Among the Asas,” the ‘Ynglinga Saga’
adds, “it was forbidden for such near relatives to come
together.”<a id="FNanchor_1703_1703" href="#Footnote_1703_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a> In Scandinavia, according to Nordström, as also
among the ancient Germans, according to Grimm, marriages
between parents and children, brothers and sisters, were
prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_1704_1704" href="#Footnote_1704_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a></p>

<p>Unions with sisters, or probably, in most cases, half-sisters,
occur in the royal families of Baghirmi,<a id="FNanchor_1705_1705" href="#Footnote_1705_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a> Siam,<a id="FNanchor_1706_1706" href="#Footnote_1706_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a> Burma,<a id="FNanchor_1707_1707" href="#Footnote_1707_1707" class="fnanchor">1707</a>
Ceylon,<a id="FNanchor_1708_1708" href="#Footnote_1708_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a> and Polynesia.<a id="FNanchor_1709_1709" href="#Footnote_1709_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a> In the Sandwich Islands, brothers
and sisters of the reigning family intermarried, but this
incestuous intercourse was in other cases contrary to the
customs, habits, and feelings of the people.<a id="FNanchor_1710_1710" href="#Footnote_1710_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> And, in Iboína
of Madagascar, where the kings were occasionally united
with their sisters, such marriages were preceded by a
ceremony in which the woman was sprinkled with consecrated
water, and prayers were recited asking for her
happiness and fecundity, as if there was a fear that the union
might call down divine anger upon the parties.<a id="FNanchor_1711_1711" href="#Footnote_1711_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> Cambyses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and other Persian kings married their sisters,<a id="FNanchor_1712_1712" href="#Footnote_1712_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a> and so did the
Ptolemies of Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_1713_1713" href="#Footnote_1713_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a> According to Sir Gardner Wilkinson,
it is not only noticed by Diodorus, but is fully authenticated
by the inscriptions both of Upper and Lower Egypt, that the
same custom was in force among the Egyptians, from the
earliest times;<a id="FNanchor_1714_1714" href="#Footnote_1714_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> but, except in the case of the Ptolemies, I
have seen no clear evidence that marriage took place
between brothers and sisters who had both the same father
and the same mother. Garcilasso de la Vega states that
the Incas of Peru, from the first, established it as a very
stringent law that the heir to the kingdom should marry his
eldest sister, legitimate both on the side of the father and on
that of the mother;<a id="FNanchor_1715_1715" href="#Footnote_1715_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a> whereas, according to Acosta and
Ondegardo, it had always been held unlawful by the Peruvians
to contract marriage in the first degree, until Tupac Inca
Yupanqui, at the close of the fifteenth century, married his
sister on the fathers side, and decreed “that the Incas
might marry with their sisters by the father’s side, and no
other.”<a id="FNanchor_1716_1716" href="#Footnote_1716_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a></p>

<p>It has been asserted that, where the system of exogamy
prevails, a man is allowed to marry his sister either on the
father’s or on the mother’s side, according as descent is
reckoned in the female or in the male line.<a id="FNanchor_1717_1717" href="#Footnote_1717_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a> But it will
be shown directly that, besides the rules relating to exogamy,
there are commonly others prohibiting intermarriage of
near relations belonging to different tribes or clans. Yet
the marriage of half-brother and half-sister is not rare.
Among the Ostyaks, for instance, union with a half-sister
bearing another family name is in great repute;<a id="FNanchor_1718_1718" href="#Footnote_1718_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a> and the
South Slavonian Mohammedans allow marriages between
half-brothers and half-sisters who have different mothers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
though seducing a sister is regarded in their songs as a
crime punishable with death, or rather as something which
cannot occur.<a id="FNanchor_1719_1719" href="#Footnote_1719_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> From the Book of Genesis we know that
Abraham married his half-sister, and looked upon the union
as lawful, because she had not the same mother.<a id="FNanchor_1720_1720" href="#Footnote_1720_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> Among
the Phœnicians at Tyre, down to the time of Achilles
Tatius, a man might marry his father’s daughter: and the
same thing appears at Mecca.<a id="FNanchor_1721_1721" href="#Footnote_1721_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a> Marriage with half-sisters
on the father’s side, not on the mother’s, was also allowed
among the Assyrians<a id="FNanchor_1722_1722" href="#Footnote_1722_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> and the Athenians.<a id="FNanchor_1723_1723" href="#Footnote_1723_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> In Guatemala
and Yucatan, on the other hand, no relationship on the
mother’s side was a bar to marriage: hence a man could
marry his sister, provided she was by another father.<a id="FNanchor_1724_1724" href="#Footnote_1724_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a></p>

<p>Among certain peoples the relationships of uncle and niece,
and of aunt and nephew, are the remotest degrees of consanguinity
which are a hindrance to intermarriage. This is
the case, for instance, with some of the Dyak tribes;<a id="FNanchor_1725_1725" href="#Footnote_1725_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a> and
among the Copper Indians, according to Franklin, there is
no prohibition of the intermarriage of cousins, but a man is
forbidden to marry his niece.<a id="FNanchor_1726_1726" href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> On the whole, we may say
that marriage within these degrees of relationship is even
more commonly prohibited than intermarriage of cousins,
and that, probably in most cases, the prohibitions refer to
persons so related either on the father’s or mother’s side.<a id="FNanchor_1727_1727" href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Yet there are many instances to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_1728_1728" href="#Footnote_1728_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> The Ossetes
consider a marriage with a mother’s sister quite a proper
thing, though a marriage with a father’s sister would be
punished as highly incestuous.<a id="FNanchor_1729_1729" href="#Footnote_1729_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> Among the Reddies of the
South of India, a man marries his sister’s daughter, but a
nephew must not marry his aunt;<a id="FNanchor_1730_1730" href="#Footnote_1730_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a> and, among the Brazilian
Tupis, an uncle had even a right to his niece’s hand.<a id="FNanchor_1731_1731" href="#Footnote_1731_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> By the
Prussian law, marriage between uncle and niece is permitted;
whilst, in France, such marriages may be sanctioned by the
Government, in Italy by the King.<a id="FNanchor_1732_1732" href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a></p>

<p>In Europe, first cousins are not restricted from intermarriage,
except in Spain, where the old canonical prohibitions
are still in force; and in Russia, where third cousins
are allowed to marry, but no parties more nearly related.<a id="FNanchor_1733_1733" href="#Footnote_1733_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a>
Among the Mohammedans<a id="FNanchor_1734_1734" href="#Footnote_1734_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> and several uncivilized peoples,
marriages between cousins, both on the paternal and maternal
side, are permitted. So, apparently, among the Aleuts,<a id="FNanchor_1735_1735" href="#Footnote_1735_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a>
Eskimo at Igloolik,<a id="FNanchor_1736_1736" href="#Footnote_1736_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a> Apalachites,<a id="FNanchor_1737_1737" href="#Footnote_1737_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> Maoris, Bushmans<a id="FNanchor_1738_1738" href="#Footnote_1738_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> and
Ainos,<a id="FNanchor_1739_1739" href="#Footnote_1739_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a>—besides the people just referred to. More commonly,
however, the permission is one-sided, referring either
to the kinsfolk on the father’s, or to those on the mother’s
side. Among the Arabs, a man has even a right to the hand
of his paternal cousin, who cannot without his consent,
become the wife of any other person.<a id="FNanchor_1740_1740" href="#Footnote_1740_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a> Concerning the
Moors of Ceylon, Mr. Ahamadu Bawa states that in all cases
where eligible sons of mothers’ brothers or fathers’ sisters
were available for the girls, preference was accorded to them,
“almost as a matter of right.”<a id="FNanchor_1741_1741" href="#Footnote_1741_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a> Among the savage Miao of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
China, the girls are obliged to marry the mother’s brothers’
sons.<a id="FNanchor_1742_1742" href="#Footnote_1742_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a> The Gonds consider it correct for the brother’s
daughter to marry the sister’s son, whilst not so much stress
is laid on the marriage of the cousins, if the sister’s child
happens to be a girl and the brother’s a boy.<a id="FNanchor_1743_1743" href="#Footnote_1743_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> Among the
Yerkalas of Southern India, “the first two daughters of a
family may be claimed by the maternal uncle as wives for his
sons.”<a id="FNanchor_1744_1744" href="#Footnote_1744_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a></p>

<p>As a rule, among peoples unaffected by modern civilization
the prohibited degrees are more numerous than in advanced
communities, the prohibitions in a great many cases referring
even to all the members of the tribe or clan.</p>

<p>The Greenlanders, according to Egede, refrained from
marrying their nearest kin, even in the third degree, considering
such matches to be “unwarrantable and quite unnatural;”<a id="FNanchor_1745_1745" href="#Footnote_1745_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a>
whilst Dr. Rink asserts that “the Eskimo disapproves
of marriages between cousins.”<a id="FNanchor_1746_1746" href="#Footnote_1746_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> The same is the
case with the Ingaliks,<a id="FNanchor_1747_1747" href="#Footnote_1747_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a> the Chippewas,<a id="FNanchor_1748_1748" href="#Footnote_1748_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a> and, as a rule, the
Indians of Oregon.<a id="FNanchor_1749_1749" href="#Footnote_1749_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> The Californian Gualala account it
“poison,” as they say, for a person to marry a cousin or an
avuncular relation, and strictly observe in marriage the Mosaic
table of prohibited affinities.<a id="FNanchor_1750_1750" href="#Footnote_1750_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> “By the old custom of the Aht
tribes,” Mr. Sproat remarks, “no marriage was permitted within
the degree of second cousin;”<a id="FNanchor_1751_1751" href="#Footnote_1751_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> and among the Mahlemuts,
“cousins, however remote, do not marry.”<a id="FNanchor_1752_1752" href="#Footnote_1752_1752" class="fnanchor">1752</a> Commonly a man
and woman belonging to the same clan are prohibited from
intermarrying. The Algonquins tell of cases where men, for
breaking this rule, have been put to death by their nearest
kinsfolk;<a id="FNanchor_1753_1753" href="#Footnote_1753_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a> and, among the Loucheux Indians, if a man
marries within the clan, he is said to have married his sister,
though there be not the slightest connection by blood between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
the two.<a id="FNanchor_1754_1754" href="#Footnote_1754_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> In some tribes, as Mr. Frazer points out, the
marriage prohibition only extends to a man’s own clan: he
may marry a woman of any clan but his own. But oftener
the prohibition includes several clans, in none of which is a
man allowed to marry.<a id="FNanchor_1755_1755" href="#Footnote_1755_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> Thus, for instance, the Seneca tribe
of the Iroquois was divided into two “phratries,” or divisions
intermediate between the tribe and the clan, each including
four clans; the Bear, Wolf, Beaver, and Turtle clans forming
one phratry, and the Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk clans
forming the other. Originally marriage was prohibited within
the phratry, but was permitted with any of the clans of the
other phratry; but the prohibition was long since removed,
and a Seneca may marry a woman of any clan but his own.<a id="FNanchor_1756_1756" href="#Footnote_1756_1756" class="fnanchor">1756</a>
A like exogamous division existed among the other four
tribes of the Iroquois,<a id="FNanchor_1757_1757" href="#Footnote_1757_1757" class="fnanchor">1757</a> as also among the Creeks, Moquis,
Choctaws, Chickasaws, Thlinkets, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_1758_1758" href="#Footnote_1758_1758" class="fnanchor">1758</a></p>

<p>Among the Pipiles of Salvador, an ancestral tree, with seven
main branches, denoting degrees of kindred, was painted upon
cloth, and within these seven branches or degrees, no one was
allowed to marry, except as a recompense for some great
public or warlike service rendered. But within four degrees
of consanguinity none, under any pretext, might marry.<a id="FNanchor_1759_1759" href="#Footnote_1759_1759" class="fnanchor">1759</a> In
Yucatan, there was a strong prejudice against a man wedding
a woman who bore the same name as his own, and so far was
this fancy carried, that he who broke the rule was looked
upon as a renegade and an outcast. Nor could a man marry
his mother’s sister.<a id="FNanchor_1760_1760" href="#Footnote_1760_1760" class="fnanchor">1760</a> Among the Azteks, too, marriages
between blood-relations or those descended from a common
ancestor were not allowed.<a id="FNanchor_1761_1761" href="#Footnote_1761_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a></p>

<p>Among the tribes of Guiana, according to Mr. Im Thurn,
marriage is now almost always, as formerly it was always,
contracted between members of different families, and, descent
being traced through females, no intermarriage with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
relations on the mother’s side is permitted.<a id="FNanchor_1762_1762" href="#Footnote_1762_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> The Mundrucûs
are divided into clans, the members of which are strictly prohibited
from forming alliances with others of the same clan.
“A Mundrucû Indian,” says Professor Agassiz, “treats a
woman of the same order (clan) with himself as a sister,
any nearer relation between them is impossible.”<a id="FNanchor_1763_1763" href="#Footnote_1763_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a> The
Indians of Peru are restricted from marriage within the
first four degrees.<a id="FNanchor_1764_1764" href="#Footnote_1764_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a> The Guaranies and Abipones abhor
alliances with even the remotest relations.<a id="FNanchor_1765_1765" href="#Footnote_1765_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a> And as to the
Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes to me that
“no marriage, no intercourse ever takes place among blood-relations
even to second cousins.” Such intercourse is held in
utter abomination and is never heard of. Also between half-brothers
and half-sisters marriages do not occur.</p>

<p>Nowhere is marriage bound by more severe laws than
among the Australian aborigines. Their tribes are, as a rule—and
probably as a rule without exceptions<a id="FNanchor_1766_1766" href="#Footnote_1766_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a>—grouped in
exogamous subdivisions, the number of which varies considerably.
There are tribes in which members of any clan
are free to marry members of any clan but their own; but
such tribes are exceptional.<a id="FNanchor_1767_1767" href="#Footnote_1767_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a> “Often,” says Mr. Frazer, “an
Australian tribe is divided into two (exogamous) phratries, each
of which includes under it a number of totem clans; and
oftener still there are sub-phratries interposed between the
phratry and the clans, each phratry including two sub-phratries,
and the sub-phratries including totem clans.”<a id="FNanchor_1768_1768" href="#Footnote_1768_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> Most of Mr.
Curr’s very numerous correspondents who have touched on
this question have, however, given the number of subdivisions
in their neighbourhood as four only.<a id="FNanchor_1769_1769" href="#Footnote_1769_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a> Before the occupation
of the country by the whites, which quickly breaks down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
aboriginal customs, any departure from the marriage system
founded on this division was looked on with absolute horror,
and even spoken of with reluctance. Indeed, when marriage
or sexual intercourse with a person of a forbidden clan did
occur, the regular penalty inflicted on the parties implicated
was death.<a id="FNanchor_1770_1770" href="#Footnote_1770_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a> And it is a noteworthy fact, generally overlooked
by anthropologists, that besides these prohibitions arising from
the clan-system and, naturally, applying only to the father’s
or, more generally, only to the mother’s relations, there is, as
it seems everywhere, a law which forbids the marriage of
persons near of kin.<a id="FNanchor_1771_1771" href="#Footnote_1771_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a> “A man,” says Mr. Curr, “may not
marry his mother, sister, half-sister, daughter, granddaughter,
aunt, niece, first or second cousin.”<a id="FNanchor_1772_1772" href="#Footnote_1772_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> Among the Kurnai of
Gippsland, according to Mr. Bulmer, even third cousins are
within the prohibited degrees of relationship.<a id="FNanchor_1773_1773" href="#Footnote_1773_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a> Moreover,
certain tribes, besides having the clan-system, are entirely
exogamous;<a id="FNanchor_1774_1774" href="#Footnote_1774_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a> and, among the tribes of Western Victoria
described by Mr. Dawson, the laws also forbid a man to marry
into his mother’s tribe, or his grandmother’s tribe or into an
adjoining tribe, or one that speaks his own dialect.<a id="FNanchor_1775_1775" href="#Footnote_1775_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a></p>

<p>In Tasmania, a man was not permitted to marry a woman of
his own tribe (clan?);<a id="FNanchor_1776_1776" href="#Footnote_1776_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a> and in Polynesia, marriages with blood-relations
were everywhere avoided except in royal families.<a id="FNanchor_1777_1777" href="#Footnote_1777_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a>
Thus in Samoa, according to Mr. Turner, so much care was
taken to prevent incest that a list of what they deemed im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>proper
marriages would almost compare with the ‘Table of
Kindred and Affinity.’ They say that, of old, custom and the
gods frowned upon the union of those in whom consanguinity
could be closely traced.<a id="FNanchor_1778_1778" href="#Footnote_1778_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the aborigines of the Melanesian islands, Dr.
Codrington observes, “In the native view of mankind, almost
everywhere in the islands which are here under consideration,
nothing seems more fundamental than the division of the
people into two or more classes, which are exogamous, and
in which descent is counted through the mother.” Yet “the
blood connection with the father and the father’s near
relations is never out of sight. Consequently the marriage of
those who are near in blood, though they are not ‘sogoi’
(<i>i.e.</i>, kindred), and may lawfully marry, is discountenanced.”<a id="FNanchor_1779_1779" href="#Footnote_1779_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a>
In New Britain, if a man were accused of adultery or fornication

<p>Among the Sea Dyaks, it is contrary to custom for a man
to wed a first cousin, who is looked upon as a sister, and no
marriage is allowed with aunt or niece. The Land Dyaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
permit marriage between second cousins only after the payment
of a fine of two jars, one being given by the woman

does take place, the parties are fined if within the third

<p>With reference to the Karens of Burma, Dr. Bunker informs
me that, though they never marry outside their own tribe, they
avoid marrying with near relations, their prohibited degrees
being nearly the same as those of the ancient Hebrews. Among
the Kukis, according to Lieutenant Stewart, “the most strict
rules exist forbidding too close intermarriage in families;
cousins cannot be so allied.”<a id="FNanchor_1798_1798" href="#Footnote_1798_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a> The Nagas never permit
marriage within the same family;<a id="FNanchor_1799_1799" href="#Footnote_1799_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a> and, among the Chukmas,
if near relatives, within certain prohibited degrees, fall in love
with each other, it is usual for both of them to pay a fine of
fifty rupees, corporal punishment being also administered.<a id="FNanchor_1800_1800" href="#Footnote_1800_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a>
Among the Kandhs, “intermarriage between persons of the

and punishable with death.”<a id="FNanchor_1801_1801" href="#Footnote_1801_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a> The Santals make it
a rule not to intermarry into the same tribe;<a id="FNanchor_1802_1802" href="#Footnote_1802_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a> and, among the

<p>According to Lieutenant-Colonel Tod, no Rajput can marry
in his own clan.<a id="FNanchor_1806_1806" href="#Footnote_1806_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a> “In all pure Hindu society,” Sir Alfred
Lyall states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> “the law which regulates the degrees within which
marriage is interdicted, proceeds upon the theory that between
agnatic relatives <i>connubium</i> is impossible.”<a id="FNanchor_1807_1807" href="#Footnote_1807_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a> Hence it is unlawful
for a Brahman to wed a woman whose clan-name is the
same as his own, a prohibition which bars marriage among
relatives in the male line indefinitely. But besides this, connections
on the female side are also forbidden to take place
within certain wide limits.<a id="FNanchor_1808_1808" href="#Footnote_1808_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> In the ‘Laws of Manu’ we read
that a damsel “who is neither a Sapindâ<a id="FNanchor_1809_1809" href="#Footnote_1809_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a> on the mother’s
side, nor belongs to the same family on the father’s side, is
recommended to twice-born men for wedlock and conjugal
union.”<a id="FNanchor_1810_1810" href="#Footnote_1810_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a> Yet in the older literature marriage with the

of Southern India, and, as it seems, among other tribes belonging
to the Hindu stock; whereas children of fathers’ brothers
and mothers’ sisters are considered equal to brothers and
sisters, and marriage with them is looked upon as highly
incestuous.<a id="FNanchor_1812_1812" href="#Footnote_1812_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Andamanese, Mr. Man says that “their
customs do not permit of the union of any who are known to
be even distantly related; the fact of our allowing first cousins
to marry seems to them highly objectionable and immoral.”<a id="FNanchor_1813_1813" href="#Footnote_1813_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a>
The Sinhalese consider a marriage between the father’s
sister’s son and the mother’s brother’s daughter the most
proper that they can contract; but they would regard a
marriage with the father’s brother’s daughter as incestuous,
first cousins so related being considered sisters.<a id="FNanchor_1814_1814" href="#Footnote_1814_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>As regards the prohibited degrees of the Chinese Penal
Code, a very minute account is given by Mr. Medhurst in his
interesting paper on ‘Marriage, Affinity, and Inheritance in
China.’<a id="FNanchor_1815_1815" href="#Footnote_1815_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a> Large bodies of persons in that country bear the
same surname; among the entire Chinese population of the
Empire, indeed, there are hardly more than 530 surnames. A
penalty of sixty blows is inflicted on any one who marries a
person with the same surname.<a id="FNanchor_1816_1816" href="#Footnote_1816_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a> The punishment attached
to the intermarriage of nearer relations on the father’s side is
much more severe. Thus, marriage or incestuous intercourse
with a grand-uncle, a father’s first cousin, a brother, or a
nephew, is punishable by death.<a id="FNanchor_1817_1817" href="#Footnote_1817_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a> Besides these prohibitions
there are others applying within a narrower range to relatives
on the female side. A man who marries his mother’s sister
or his sister’s daughter is strangled. Less severe punishment
is inflicted on a person who marries a uterine half-sister,
and still less severe—eighty blows—on any one who marries
his father’s sister’s daughter, mother’s brother’s daughter,
or mother’s sister’s daughter. An after-clause abrogates
this prohibition, and permits intermarriage between children
of brothers and sisters, or of sisters, but intermarriage
between those of brothers is of course inadmissible.<a id="FNanchor_1818_1818" href="#Footnote_1818_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a> The
Chinese Code also interdicts occasional intercourse with any
of those relatives with whom marriage is prohibited, the
punishment in both cases being the same.<a id="FNanchor_1819_1819" href="#Footnote_1819_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a></p>

<p>Among the Kalmucks, no man can marry a relation on the
father’s side; and so deeply rooted is this custom among
them, that a Kalmuck proverb says, “The great folk and dogs
know no relationship,”—alluding to the fact that only a
prince may marry a relative.<a id="FNanchor_1820_1820" href="#Footnote_1820_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a> The Yakuts,<a id="FNanchor_1821_1821" href="#Footnote_1821_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> Samoyedes,<a id="FNanchor_1822_1822" href="#Footnote_1822_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Cheremises,<a id="FNanchor_1823_1823" href="#Footnote_1823_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a> &amp;c., also avoid marriage within the paternal clan,
and the ancient Finns did not marry kinsfolk.<a id="FNanchor_1824_1824" href="#Footnote_1824_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a> Among the
Ostyaks<a id="FNanchor_1825_1825" href="#Footnote_1825_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a> and Ossetes,<a id="FNanchor_1826_1826" href="#Footnote_1826_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a> marriage with a person of one’s own
family name, however distant the relationship, is entirely
prohibited. And in Circassia, according to Bell, not only are
cousins, or the members of the same fraternity restricted from
intermarrying, but even their serfs must wed with the serfs of
another fraternity.<a id="FNanchor_1827_1827" href="#Footnote_1827_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a></p>

<p>Among the Bogos of Eastern Africa, persons related within
the seventh degree may not intermarry, whether the relationship
be on the paternal or maternal side.<a id="FNanchor_1828_1828" href="#Footnote_1828_1828" class="fnanchor">1828</a> Some of the clans
of the Somals, as we are informed by Sir R. F. Burton, refuse
maidens of the same or even a consanguineous family.<a id="FNanchor_1829_1829" href="#Footnote_1829_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a> In
Western Equatorial Africa and Uganda, marriages cannot

may be.<a id="FNanchor_1830_1830" href="#Footnote_1830_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a> Among the Mpongwé, “every care is taken to avoid

Sims writes from Stanley Pool, marriages are prohibited
between brothers and sisters of the same mother or father;
between first cousins; between uncle and niece, or aunt and
nephew. The Bakongo also, according to Mr. Ingham, hold
all unions between near relatives, either on the father’s or
mother’s side, in utter abomination.</p>

<p>Mr. Cousins, to whom I am indebted for a valuable paper
on the Cis-Natalian Kafirs, writes that, among them, marriages
often take place within the tribe and village. But this is
avoided, if possible; like their chiefs they generally endeavour
to marry out of their own tribe. Among this people,
however, there is some kind of class (clan?) division, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Mr. Cousins is not fully acquainted with, and members of the
same class (clan?) do not seem to intermarry. At any rate, near
relations, paternal and maternal, avoid marriage with each
other. No penalty is attached to such a marriage, but custom
is so strong on the point that the general rule is seldom
broken.<a id="FNanchor_1832_1832" href="#Footnote_1832_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a> According to Mr. Shooter<a id="FNanchor_1833_1833" href="#Footnote_1833_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a> and Mr. Dugmore,<a id="FNanchor_1834_1834" href="#Footnote_1834_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a> a
marriage is considered incestuous if the man and woman are
of any known or remembered degree of relationship by
common descent; and, if a man were to take a wife within
the degrees prohibited by custom, he would be denounced as
an “evildoer.”<a id="FNanchor_1835_1835" href="#Footnote_1835_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a> According to Mr. Brownlee, intercourse in
such cases is punished, whether it be by marriage or without
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1836_1836" href="#Footnote_1836_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a> Again, with regard to the Zulus, Mr. Eyles states
that there is no intermarriage between the inhabitants of the
village, the members of which are, as a rule, related. All
intermarrying with relations is prohibited by custom, and
such a thing is neither heard of nor thought of. Even if
the relationship is only traditional, the custom holds good.</p>

<p>A somewhat different account of the Bantu race is given
by Mr. McCall Theal. “A native of the coast region,” he
says, “will not marry a girl whose relationship by blood to
himself can be traced, no matter how distantly connected
they may be. So scrupulous is he in this respect that he will
not marry even a girl who belongs to another tribe, if she
has the same family name as himself, though the relationship
cannot be traced. He regards himself as the protector of
those females whom he would term his cousins and second
cousins, but for whom he has only the same name as for the
daughters of his own parents, the endearing name of sister.
In his opinion, union with one of them would be incestuous,
something horrible, something unutterably disgraceful. The
native of the mountains, almost as a rule, marries the daughter
of his father’s brother.”<a id="FNanchor_1837_1837" href="#Footnote_1837_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a></p>

<p>Mr. Conder states that, among the Bechuanas, marrying out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
of their own tribe seems to be the common practice;<a id="FNanchor_1838_1838" href="#Footnote_1838_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> whereas,
according to Mr. Casalis, the Basutos frequently marry
cousins. Yet, among them also, there are some tribes who
consider such marriages incestuous.<a id="FNanchor_1839_1839" href="#Footnote_1839_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> The Hottentots are
said by Kolben to punish alliances between first and second
cousins with death.<a id="FNanchor_1840_1840" href="#Footnote_1840_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> In Madagascar, though marriage between
brothers’ children is looked upon as the most proper kind of
connection, and brothers’ and sisters’ children can marry
on the performance of a slight but prescribed ceremony,
supposed to remove any impediment or disqualification arising
out of consanguinity, the descendants of sisters are not allowed
to intermarry down to the fifth or seventh generation, and a
marriage of sisters’ children, when the sisters have the same
mother, is regarded with horror.<a id="FNanchor_1841_1841" href="#Footnote_1841_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a></p>

<p>Among the Romans, alliances between persons under the
same <i>patria potestas</i>—<i>i.e.</i>, <i>cognati</i> related within the sixth degree—were
<i>nefariæ et incestuæ nuptiæ</i>; but these prohibitions
were gradually relaxed. From the time of the Second Punic
War, according to Livy, even first cousins were allowed to
intermarry; and in 49 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> the Emperor Claudius, wishing
to marry his niece Agrippina, obtained from the Senate a
decree that marriage with a brother’s daughter should be legal,
though marriage with a sister’s daughter remained illegal.<a id="FNanchor_1842_1842" href="#Footnote_1842_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a>
In the fourth century, however, Constantius again forbade
such unions, on pain of death.<a id="FNanchor_1843_1843" href="#Footnote_1843_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a> Afterwards, under the
influence of the ascetic ideas prevalent in the Church, the
prohibited degrees were gradually extended. Theodosius the
Great forbade under the severest penalties the union of first
cousins, paternal and maternal; and at the end of the sixth
century the prohibition was extended even to the seventh
degree. This prohibition continued in force until in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Western Church it was once more reduced to the fourth degree
by the Lateran Council under Innocent III. in the year 1215;
that is, marriage was permitted beyond the degree of third
cousins.<a id="FNanchor_1844_1844" href="#Footnote_1844_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a> Such is the nominal law at the present time
wherever the canon law prevails.<a id="FNanchor_1845_1845" href="#Footnote_1845_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a></p>

<p>Besides the prohibitions relating to actual kinship, there are,
among several peoples, others applying to marriage between
relatives by alliance. Among the Andamanese, a man or
woman may not marry into the family of a brother-in-law or
sister-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_1846_1846" href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a> The Eastern Greenlanders and the Eskimo
of the north-east coast of America forbid or disapprove of
marriage with two sisters;<a id="FNanchor_1847_1847" href="#Footnote_1847_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a> and, according to Dr. Daniell,
the same rule prevails among the natives of Accra at the
Gold Coast, who even prohibit a man from marrying two
cousins of the same parentage.<a id="FNanchor_1848_1848" href="#Footnote_1848_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a> Again, several tribes in
Western Victoria do not permit marriage with a deceased
wife’s daughter by a former husband.<a id="FNanchor_1849_1849" href="#Footnote_1849_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a> But prohibitions of
this sort do not seem to be very common among savage and
barbarous races. In many of the Indian tribes of North
America, all the daughters of a family are, as a rule, married
to the same man. A brother very frequently marries his
deceased brother’s widow; and, in Africa, a son often weds
all his father’s widows except his own mother.</p>

<p>Among civilized peoples, on the other hand, relations by
affinity are frequently regarded in the same light as relations
by blood. In Yucatan, a man was not allowed to marry his
sister-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_1850_1850" href="#Footnote_1850_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a> According to the Chinese Code, marriage with a
deceased brother’s widow is punished with strangulation, whilst
marriage with a deceased wife’s sister is exceedingly common,
and has always been regarded as particularly honourable.<a id="FNanchor_1851_1851" href="#Footnote_1851_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a>
In Japan, intercourse with a father’s or a grandfather’s
concubine, or a son’s or grandson’s wife, involves the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
punishment as intercourse with a paternal aunt or a sister.<a id="FNanchor_1852_1852" href="#Footnote_1852_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a>
The ‘Institutes of Vishnu’ declare that “sexual connection
with one’s mother, or daughter, or daughter-in-law, are crimes
in the highest degree,” there being no other way to atone for
these crimes than to proceed into the flames.<a id="FNanchor_1853_1853" href="#Footnote_1853_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> According to
the laws of Moses<a id="FNanchor_1854_1854" href="#Footnote_1854_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a> and Mohammed<a id="FNanchor_1855_1855" href="#Footnote_1855_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> and the Roman Law<a id="FNanchor_1856_1856" href="#Footnote_1856_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a>
marriage was prohibited with mother-in-law, step-mother,
daughter-in-law, and step-daughter—according to Mohammed,
however, so far as the step-daughter was concerned, only if
she were under the guardianship of her mother’s husband.
Moses also forbade marriage with the sister of a wife who
was still living,<a id="FNanchor_1857_1857" href="#Footnote_1857_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a> and with a brother’s wife, if she were
widowed and had children by the brother; and Mohammed
prohibited marriage with two sisters at the same time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From very early times thinkers have tried to account for
the prohibition of marriage between near kin. Some, says
Mr. Huth, ascribe them to a fear lest relationship may
become too involved; others to a fear lest affection may become
concentrated within too narrow a circle; because marriage
would take place too early; because people would be induced
to marry each other in order that property might be kept in
the family; because such marriages are prohibited by “God’s
law”; because they outrage “natural modesty”; and, only in
modern times, because they are supposed to prove injurious
to the offspring.<a id="FNanchor_1858_1858" href="#Footnote_1858_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a></p>

<p>Comparative ethnography has changed the aspect of the
question. The horror of incest has been found to prevail
among peoples who neither know anything of “God’s law,” nor
possess property to keep in the family. New hypotheses have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
therefore been suggested more worthy of consideration, as
being founded on a much firmer basis of facts.</p>

<p>The late Mr. McLennan was the first to call attention to the
general prevalence of the rule which forbids the members of a
tribe (or clan) to intermarry with members of their own tribe
(or clan). This rule he called “exogamy,” in contradistinction
to “endogamy,” or the rule which forbids the members of a
tribe to intermarry with members of other tribes. In his celebrated
essay on ‘Primitive Marriage’ he made an attempt to
show that exogamy had arisen from female infanticide,
“common among savages everywhere.” He assumes that
to tribes surrounded by enemies, and unaided by art,
contending with the difficulties of subsistence, sons were a
source of strength, both for defence and in the quest for food,
whilst daughters were a source of weakness. Hence the
cruel custom which left the primitive human hordes with
very few young women, thus seriously disturbing the balance
of the sexes within the hordes, and forcing them to prey upon
one another for wives. Usage, induced by necessity, would
then in time establish a prejudice among the tribes observing
it—a prejudice strong as a principle of religion, as every prejudice
relating to marriage is apt to be—against marrying
women of their own tribe.<a id="FNanchor_1859_1859" href="#Footnote_1859_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a></p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer has subjected this hypothesis to a
searching criticism,<a id="FNanchor_1860_1860" href="#Footnote_1860_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a> and from an article in the ‘Fortnightly
Review’ it appears as if Mr. McLennan himself had in the end
some doubts as to its correctness.<a id="FNanchor_1861_1861" href="#Footnote_1861_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a> To Mr. Spencer’s objections
others might be added.</p>

<p>A minute investigation of the extent to which female
infanticide is practised has convinced me that Mr. McLennan
has much exaggerated the importance of this custom. It certainly
prevails in many parts of the world; and it is true that,
as a rule, female children are killed rather than male. But
there is nothing to indicate that infanticide has ever been so
nearly universal, or has anywhere been practised on so large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
a scale as Mr. McLennan’s hypothesis presupposes. Among
a great many existing savage peoples it is almost unheard
of—as, for instance, among the Tuski,<a id="FNanchor_1862_1862" href="#Footnote_1862_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> Ahts,<a id="FNanchor_1863_1863" href="#Footnote_1863_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> Western
Eskimo,<a id="FNanchor_1864_1864" href="#Footnote_1864_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> Botocudos,<a id="FNanchor_1865_1865" href="#Footnote_1865_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a> and in certain tribes of California.<a id="FNanchor_1866_1866" href="#Footnote_1866_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a>
Among some of these peoples new-born children are killed now
and then—in case of the birth of twins, if the children are
weak and deformed, or for some other reason—but always, it
is said, without distinction of sex. Among the Dacotahs and
Crees, female infanticide is only occasionally committed.<a id="FNanchor_1867_1867" href="#Footnote_1867_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a>
The Blackfeet, according to Richardson, believe that women
who have been guilty of this crime will never reach the
happy mountain after death, but are compelled to hover round
the seats of their crimes, with branches of trees tied to their
legs;<a id="FNanchor_1868_1868" href="#Footnote_1868_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> and the Aleuts think that a child-murder brings misfortune
on the whole village.<a id="FNanchor_1869_1869" href="#Footnote_1869_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a> Among the Abipones, the
women often practised infanticide, but it was the boy who was
generally thus sacrificed, for when a son grew up it was
necessary to buy a wife for him, while a grown-up daughter
would always command her price.<a id="FNanchor_1870_1870" href="#Footnote_1870_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a></p>

<p>In Africa I do not know of a single district where the
people are in the habit of destroying new-born children.
Herr Valdau tells us of a Bakundu woman who, accused of
such a deed, was condemned to death.<a id="FNanchor_1871_1871" href="#Footnote_1871_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a></p>

<p>Until the introduction of Christianity, the South Sea
Islanders practised infanticide probably to a greater extent
than any other people with whose history we are acquainted.
But as the motive was often want of food for the infant, or
interference with the personal charms of the wife, or the
disagreeableness of baby life, boys as well as girls were killed.
Moreover, in Samoa, in the Mitchell’s and Hervey Groups, and
in part of New Guinea, infanticide was quite unheard of;<a id="FNanchor_1872_1872" href="#Footnote_1872_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
whilst, in most of the islands belonging to the Solomon Group,
it occurs only in extreme cases, such as that of the child being
a bastard.<a id="FNanchor_1873_1873" href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> In the Caroline Islands, according to Chamisso,
“the prince would have the unnatural mother punished with
death.”<a id="FNanchor_1874_1874" href="#Footnote_1874_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> And even in Australia, where, according to Mr.
Curr’s belief, the women reared as a rule, only two boys and one
girl, the rest being destroyed,<a id="FNanchor_1875_1875" href="#Footnote_1875_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a> there seem to be tribes in
which the killing of children rarely happens.<a id="FNanchor_1876_1876" href="#Footnote_1876_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a></p>

<p>There are other reasons, besides those just given, for doubting
whether infanticide can ever have been so common as Mr.
McLennan suggests. It may be assumed, as Mr. Darwin remarks,
that during the earliest period of human development
man did not partially lose one of the strongest of instincts,
common to all the lower animals, namely the love of their
young, and consequently did not practise infanticide.<a id="FNanchor_1877_1877" href="#Footnote_1877_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a> Later
on, the women, far from being useless to the savage tribe, rendered
valuable services as food-providers. Mr. Fison, who has
lived among uncivilized races for many years, thinks it will be
found that female infanticide is far less common among the
lower savages than it is among the more advanced tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1878_1878" href="#Footnote_1878_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a>
And, speaking of one of the very rudest, the Yahgans of
Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges states that it occurred only
occasionally among them, and then was almost always the
deed of the mother, who acted from “jealousy, or hatred of
her husband, or because of desertion and wretchedness.”<a id="FNanchor_1879_1879" href="#Footnote_1879_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a>
Moreover, it is very generally asserted that certain Californians
never committed infanticide before the arrival of the
whites;<a id="FNanchor_1880_1880" href="#Footnote_1880_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a> whilst Ellis thinks that there is every reason to
suppose that this custom was practised less extensively by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
the Polynesians during the early periods of their history than
it was afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_1881_1881" href="#Footnote_1881_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a></p>

<p>But even if Mr. McLennan were right in his assumption
that savages everywhere used to kill female infants, this
would not explain the origin of exogamy. “In time,” he says,
“it came to be considered improper, because it was unusual,
for a man to marry a woman of his own group.”<a id="FNanchor_1882_1882" href="#Footnote_1882_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> But why
should such a marriage ever have become unusual? Why
should the men have refrained from marrying those women
of their own tribe who were not killed? Why should they have
made these beings whom they considered so useless, even
more useless than they naturally were, by preventing them from
becoming mothers of sons who would have increased the
strength of the tribe? That the men may have endeavoured
to make up the deficiency of women by capturing wives from
foreign tribes is conceivable enough; but it is hard to see why
intercourse with women of their own tribe should on this account
have been prohibited, sometimes even on pain of death.</p>

<p>That the horror of incest is innate in the human race seems
as improbable to Mr. Herbert Spencer as to Mr. McLennan.
According to Mr. Spencer, this feeling is a result of evolution
gradually acquired. Primitive groups of men, he says, are
habitually hostile. In all times and places victory is followed
by pillage; whatever portable things of worth the conquerors
find they take. And of course they take women as they take
other booty, because women are prized as wives, as concubines,
or as drudges. A captured woman, besides her intrinsic
value, has an extrinsic value: “like a native wife she serves as
a slave, but unlike a native wife, she serves also as a trophy.”
Hence members of the tribe thus married to foreign women
are held to be more honourably married than those married to
native women. If the tribe, becoming successful in war, robs
adjacent tribes of their women more frequently, there will
then grow up the idea that the now considerable class having
foreign wives form the honourable class, and non-possession
of a foreign wife will come to be regarded as a proof of
cowardice. “An increasing ambition to get foreign wives will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
therefore arise; and as the number of those who are without
them decreases, the brand of disgrace attaching to them will
grow more decided; until in the most warlike tribes, it
becomes an imperative requirement that a wife shall be obtained
from another tribe—if not in open war, then by private
abduction.”<a id="FNanchor_1883_1883" href="#Footnote_1883_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a></p>

<p>This interpretation is open to an objection similar to that
which may be brought against Mr. McLennan’s hypothesis.
Even if it became customary for a tribe to rob foreign tribes
of their women, we have no reason to believe that it therefore
became customary not to marry native women. Plurality of
wives is for savage man a source of wealth and reputation;
even the wretched Fuegian endeavours to procure as many as
possible in order to obtain rowers for his canoe. Hence it could
scarcely be considered disgraceful to have some native wives
besides those of foreign birth. If Mr. Spencer’s explanation
is the correct one, what a deplorable lot it must have been for
a woman to belong to a tribe always successful in war! She had
of course to live unmarried till she was fortunate enough to fall
into the hands of some hostile suitor. But this would seldom
happen, if the adjacent weaker tribes were habitually worsted
in war. In such tribes, according to Mr. Spencer, “marrying
within the tribe will not only be habitual, but there will arise a
prejudice, and eventually a law, against taking wives from
other tribes.”<a id="FNanchor_1884_1884" href="#Footnote_1884_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a></p>

<p>Least of all can Mr. Spencer’s hypothesis explain the origin
of prohibitions of marriage between the nearest kin. It presupposes
that the tribe has been frequently successful in war
during so long a period that usage has had time to grow into law.
But since such prohibitions are practically common to all mankind,
they cannot have originated in the way suggested, because
when there is a vanquisher there must also be a vanquished.
Moreover, it is impossible to suppose that that powerful feeling
which restrains parents from marrying their children, brothers
from marrying their sisters, can have been due to man’s vain
desire to have a trophy in his wife.<a id="FNanchor_1885_1885" href="#Footnote_1885_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock explains the origin of exogamy in a
quite different way. Believing that in man’s primitive state
all the men of a tribe were married to all the women, and that
no one could appropriate one of them to himself without
infringing on the general rights of the tribe, he suggests that
women taken in war from a foreign tribe were in a different
position. The tribe, as a tribe, had no right to these women,
and they would become wives in our sense of the term.<a id="FNanchor_1886_1886" href="#Footnote_1886_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say much about this hypothesis, as it
stands or falls with Sir J. Lubbock’s theory of “communal
marriage.” Why should women taken in war have been the
men’s personal property, if the women of the tribe were not so?
As Mr. McLennan justly remarks, war-captives are usually
obtained by group-acts, or quasi group-acts; hence capture
would be recognized as a regular mode of adding women to
the group, subject to the customary rights of its male members;
and every man in the group would claim the communal
right to women taken by others.<a id="FNanchor_1887_1887" href="#Footnote_1887_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a></p>

<p>Again, Professor Kohler has expressed his belief in the
explanation that exogamy was an early method of political
self-preservation.<a id="FNanchor_1888_1888" href="#Footnote_1888_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a> That intermarriage is valuable from a
political point of view, and has often taken place in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
increase intertribal or international friendship, is beyond
doubt.<a id="FNanchor_1889_1889" href="#Footnote_1889_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> But it is another question whether the strictly
prohibitive exogamous rules, the infringement of which is
considered a most heinous crime, can be accounted for in this
way. It is worth noticing that not only marriage, but also
less regular connections between members of the same
exogamous group are held in horror. The Australians,
for instance, consider cohabitation between individuals belonging
to clans that cannot intermarry not less criminal than
marriage, often punishing such unions with death.<a id="FNanchor_1890_1890" href="#Footnote_1890_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a> Among
the Melanesians, says Dr. Codrington, “intercourse within
the limit which restrains from marriage, where two members
of the same division are concerned, is a crime, is incest.”<a id="FNanchor_1891_1891" href="#Footnote_1891_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a>
Holm makes a similar observation on the prohibited degrees
among the Eastern Greenlanders.<a id="FNanchor_1892_1892" href="#Footnote_1892_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> Speaking of the Samoans,
Mr. Prichard remarks, “Of all their customs, the most
strictly observed, perhaps, was that which forbade the
remotest reference to anything, even by way of a joke, that
conveyed the slightest indelicacy in thought or word or
gesture, when brothers and sisters were together. In presence
of his sister, the wildest rake was always modest and moral.
In presence of her brother, the most accommodating <i>coquette</i>
was always chaste and reserved. This custom remains intact
to the present day.”<a id="FNanchor_1893_1893" href="#Footnote_1893_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a> Dr. Tylor remarks that anthropologists
have long had before them the problem of determining how
far clan-exogamy may have been the origin of the prohibited
degrees in matrimony.<a id="FNanchor_1894_1894" href="#Footnote_1894_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a> But we have seen that it is practically
impossible to trace any distinct limit between these two
sets of rules; hence they seem to be fundamentally identical—a
conclusion in which most anthropologists agree. And
the prohibitions of close intermarriage certainly cannot be
explained as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> “method of political self-preservation.”</p>

<p>Other writers—and among them Mr. Morgan—have suggested
that prohibitions of the marriage of near kin have
arisen from observation of the injurious results of such
unions.<a id="FNanchor_1895_1895" href="#Footnote_1895_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a> But most investigators who have considered the
subject believe that this knowledge could be gained only by
lengthened observation, and, to quote Dr. Peschel, is “unattainable
by unsettled and childishly heedless races,”
among whom, nevertheless, a horror of incest is developed
most strongly.<a id="FNanchor_1896_1896" href="#Footnote_1896_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a> Sir Henry Maine, on the other hand, thinks
that the men who discovered the use of fire and selected the
wild forms of certain animals for domestication and of vegetables
for cultivation, might also have been able to find out
that children of unsound constitution were born of nearly
related parents.<a id="FNanchor_1897_1897" href="#Footnote_1897_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> In the next chapter, I shall have occasion
to mention some instances which possibly may point in this
direction, but in no case does such knowledge appear to be
generally diffused among backward races. Mr. Curr has been
unable to discover on what ground consanguineous marriages
are held to be objectionable by the Australians, their replies
to questions on this head invariably being, “Our tribe always
did as we do in this matter.” Yet they are well aware, he
says, that the aim of the exogamous restrictions is to prevent
the union of nearly related individuals.<a id="FNanchor_1898_1898" href="#Footnote_1898_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a> Dr. Sims writes
that no other reason for the avoidance of marriage between
near relations has been stated to him by the indigenous
Bateke than that of “shame.” Mr. Bridges informs me that
the Yahgans point simply to the fact of relationship as the
reason; and, when Azara asked the Charruas why a brother
and sister never intermarried, they replied that they did
not know why.<a id="FNanchor_1899_1899" href="#Footnote_1899_1899" class="fnanchor">1899</a> It is conceivable that the experience of the
injurious results of such marriages, once acquired, might afterwards
have fallen into oblivion, although the prohibition continued
to exist. But Azara expressly states that the Charruas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
have no law forbidding incestuous alliances, yet he has never
seen nor heard of any among them.</p>

<p>Whatever observations may have been made, the prohibition
of incest is in no case founded on experience. Had
the savage man discerned that children born of marriage
between closely related persons are not so sound and vigorous
as others, he would scarcely have allowed this knowledge to
check his passions. Considering how seldom a civilised man
who has any disease, or tendency to disease, which is likely to
be transmitted to his descendants, hesitates to marry an
equally unhealthy woman, it would surely be unreasonable to
suppose that savages have greater forethought and self-command.<a id="FNanchor_1900_1900" href="#Footnote_1900_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a>
But even if we admit that man originally avoided
marriage with near kin from sagacious calculation, and that
he did this during so long a period that usage grew into law,
we do not advance a step further. All the writers whose
hypotheses have been considered in this chapter, assume that
men avoid incestuous marriages only because they are <i>taught</i>
to do so. “It is probable,” says Mr. Huth, “that, if brothers
and sisters were allowed to marry, they would do so while yet
too young.”<a id="FNanchor_1901_1901" href="#Footnote_1901_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a> But though law and custom may prevent
passion from passing into action, they cannot wholly destroy
its inward power. Law may forbid a son to marry his
mother, a brother his sister, but it could not prevent him from
desiring such a union if the desire were natural. Where does
that appetite exist? The home is kept pure from incestuous
defilement neither by laws, nor by customs, nor by education,
but by an <i>instinct</i> which under normal circumstances makes
sexual love between the nearest kin a psychical impossibility.
An unwritten law, says Plato, defends “as sufficiently as
possible,” parents from incestuous intercourse with their
children, brothers from intercourse with their sisters: “ἀλλ’
οὐδ’ ἐπιθυμία ταύτης τῆς συνουσίας τὸ παρ ‘παν εἰσέρχεται
τοὺς πολλοὺς”—“nor does even the desire for this intercourse
come at all upon the masses.”<a id="FNanchor_1902_1902" href="#Footnote_1902_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a></p>

<small>PROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KINDRED</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Concluded</i>)</p>


<p>It has been asserted that, if there be really an innate horror
of incest, it ought to show itself intuitively when persons are
ignorant of any relationship. But ancient writers state that,
in Rome, incestuous unions often resulted from the exposure of
infants who were reared by slave-dealers. Not long ago Selim
Pasha unwittingly married his sister, who, like himself, had
been a Circassian slave. The story told in the ‘Heptameron’
of a double incest was probably true, and became widely
spread; and so on. Man has thus no horror of marriage
with even the nearest kindred if he is unaware of their
consanguinity; consequently, Mr. Huth concludes, there is no
innate feeling against incest.<a id="FNanchor_1903_1903" href="#Footnote_1903_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a></p>

<p>Of course I agree with Mr. Huth in thinking that there is
no innate aversion to marriage with <i>near relations</i>. What I
maintain is, that there is an innate aversion to sexual intercourse
between persons living very closely together from
early youth, and that, as such persons are in most cases
related, this feeling displays itself chiefly as a horror of intercourse
between near kin.</p>

<p>The existence of an innate aversion of this kind has been
taken by various writers as a psychological fact proved by
common experience;<a id="FNanchor_1904_1904" href="#Footnote_1904_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> and it seems impossible otherwise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
explain the feeling which makes the relationships between
parents and children, and brothers and sisters, so free from all
sexual excitement. But the chief evidence is afforded by an
abundance of ethnographical facts which prove that it is not,
in the first place, by the degrees of consanguinity, but by the
close living together that prohibitory laws against intermarriage
are determined.</p>

<p>Egede asserts that, among the Greenlanders, it would be
reckoned uncouth and blamable, if a lad and a girl who
had served and been educated in one family, desired to be
married to one another;<a id="FNanchor_1905_1905" href="#Footnote_1905_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a> and, according to Dr. Nansen, it is
preferred that the contracting parties should belong to different
settlements.<a id="FNanchor_1906_1906" href="#Footnote_1906_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a> Colonel Macpherson states that, among
the Kandhs, marriage cannot take place even with strangers
who have been long adopted into, or domesticated with, a
tribe.<a id="FNanchor_1907_1907" href="#Footnote_1907_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a> And Mr. Cousins writes to me that the Cis-Natalian
Kafirs dislike marriage between persons who live very closely
together, whether related or not. In the Northern New
Hebrides, a girl betrothed in childhood is sometimes taken
to her future father-in-law’s house and brought up there.
Dr. Codrington says that “the boy often thinks she is his
sister, and is much ashamed when he comes to know the
relation in which he stands.”<a id="FNanchor_1908_1908" href="#Footnote_1908_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a></p>

<p>Many peoples have a rule of exogamy that does not depend
on kinship at all. Piedrahita relates of the Panches
of Bogota that the men and women of one town did not intermarry,
as they held themselves to be brothers and sisters,
and the impediment of kinship was sacred to them; but such
was their ignorance that, if a sister were born in a different
town from her brother, he was not prevented from marrying
her.<a id="FNanchor_1909_1909" href="#Footnote_1909_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a> The Yaméos, on the river Amazons, will not suffer an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
intermarriage between members of the same community, “as
being friends in blood, though no real affinity between them
can be proved.”<a id="FNanchor_1910_1910" href="#Footnote_1910_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a> The Uaupés, according to Mr. Wallace, “do
not often marry with relations, or even neighbours, preferring
those from a distance, or even from other tribes.”<a id="FNanchor_1911_1911" href="#Footnote_1911_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a> The
Australian tribe, as Mr. Howitt points out, is organized in
two ways. On the one hand, it is divided socially into
phratries and clans; and, on the other hand, it is divided
geographically into hordes. The two organizations are co-existent,
but the divisions of the one do not correspond with
those of the other. For while all the people who belong to any
given local group are found in one locality alone, those who
belong to any given social group are to be found distributed
among many, if not among all, of the local groups. Now,
in many tribes, local proximity by birth is quite an insuperable
obstacle to marriage, a man being absolutely forbidden
to marry, or have sexual intercourse with, a woman of
the same horde or sub-horde. “However eligible she may be
in other respects,” says Mr. Howitt, “the fact that both parties
belong to the same locality is held by certain tribes, the
Kurnai, for example, to make them ‘too near each other.’”
It is chiefly in tribes where the clan-system has been weakened,
or has become almost extinct, that the local organization
has assumed such overwhelming preponderance, but
even in some of the tribes which have a vigorous clan-system,
local restraints upon marriage are strictly enforced.<a id="FNanchor_1912_1912" href="#Footnote_1912_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a>
In Sumatra, according to Mr. Forbes, the country was
originally divided into native districts called “margas,” each
marga, as a rule, having its several villages. Each of these
village communities is a collection of families, either related
or not to each other by the ties of blood;<a id="FNanchor_1913_1913" href="#Footnote_1913_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a> and we know that,
at least among certain tribes, marriage between members of

even between those of the same marga, is prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_1914_1914" href="#Footnote_1914_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a> The

a national festival named the “Baisakh Bihu,” which is as gay
as a carnival, the women, and especially the maidens, enjoying
unusual liberty as long as it lasts. “For many days before the
actual festival,” says Colonel Dalton, “the young people in
the villages may be seen moving about in groups gaily dressed
or forming circles, in the midst of which the prettiest girls
dance with their long hair loose on their shoulders.” But on
these occasions the girls “do not like to dance before the
men of their own village.”<a id="FNanchor_1923_1923" href="#Footnote_1923_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> Professor Kovalevsky observes
that, in some parts of Russia, the bride is always taken from
another village than the bridegroom’s; and, even in provinces
in which no similar custom is known to exist, “the bridegroom
is constantly spoken of as a foreigner (‘choujoy,’ ‘choujaninin’),
and his friends and attendants are represented as coming
with him from a distant country, in order to take away the
future spouse.”<a id="FNanchor_1924_1924" href="#Footnote_1924_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a> Sir Richard Burton says, “As a general rule

<p>We have seen how variously defined the prohibited degrees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
are in the laws of nations. Facts show that the extent to
which relatives are not allowed to intermarry is nearly connected
with their close living together. Generally speaking,
the prohibited degrees are extended much farther among
savage and barbarous peoples than in civilized societies. As
a rule, the former, if they have not remained in the most
primitive social condition of man, live, not in separate families,
but in large households or communities, all the members of
which dwell in very close contact with each other.</p>

<p>The communism in the family life of the exogamous
Indians of North America has been exhaustively illustrated
by Mr. Morgan in his work on ‘Houses and House-Life of
the American Aborigines.’ “The household of the Mandans,”
he says, “consisting of from twenty to forty persons, the
households of the Columbian tribes of about the same number,
the Soshonee household of seven families, the households of
the Sauks, of the Iroquois, and of the Creeks, each composed
of several families, are fair types of the households of the
Northern Indians at the epoch of their discovery. The fact
is also established that these tribes constructed, as a rule,
large joint tenement houses, each of which was occupied by
a large household composed of several families, among whom
provisions were in common, and who practised communism
in living in the household.”<a id="FNanchor_1926_1926" href="#Footnote_1926_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a> Among the Iroquois, each
household was made up on the principle of kinship through
females, so that the married women, usually sisters, own or
collateral, being of the same gens or clan, together with their
children made a family circle, within which, as we have seen,
intermarriage was entirely prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_1927_1927" href="#Footnote_1927_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a> The Senel in California
live sometimes from twenty to thirty together in the
same immense dome-shaped or oblong lodge of willow-poles,
including all who are blood relations.<a id="FNanchor_1928_1928" href="#Footnote_1928_1928" class="fnanchor">1928</a> According to Egede,
the Greenlanders, who prohibit marriage between cousins,
continue after marriage to live in their parents’ house
together with other kindred; and what they get they all
enjoy in common.<a id="FNanchor_1929_1929" href="#Footnote_1929_1929" class="fnanchor">1929</a> The Chippewas, who consider cousins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
german in the same light as brothers and sisters, but do not
recognize relationship beyond this degree, are divided into
small bands consisting of but few families each.<a id="FNanchor_1930_1930" href="#Footnote_1930_1930" class="fnanchor">1930</a> Among
the exogamous Uaupés, the houses are the abode of numerous
families, and sometimes of a whole horde.<a id="FNanchor_1931_1931" href="#Footnote_1931_1931" class="fnanchor">1931</a> Among
the Yahgans, who regard marriage between first and second
cousins as incestuous, “occasionally as many as five families
are to be found living in a wigwam, but generally two
families.”<a id="FNanchor_1932_1932" href="#Footnote_1932_1932" class="fnanchor">1932</a></p>

<p>The Australian aborigines live mostly in small hordes,
often consisting of from thirty to fifty men, women, and
children. Such a horde, according to Mr. Brough Smyth,
“is in fact but an enlargement of a family circle, and none
within it can intermarry.”<a id="FNanchor_1933_1933" href="#Footnote_1933_1933" class="fnanchor">1933</a> Among the Efatese, in whose
clan-system the prohibition of incest is a fundamental law,
each clan is regarded as one family. “A child of <i>a</i>,” says
Mr. Macdonald, “calls her own mother mother, and all her
mother’s tribe (clan) sisters mother; and calls by the name
of father not only her own father but all his tribe (clan)
brothers; and they all call the child their child.”<a id="FNanchor_1934_1934" href="#Footnote_1934_1934" class="fnanchor">1934</a> The
Malays, according to Professor Wilken, live, as a rule, in
large houses containing a great number of differently related
persons.<a id="FNanchor_1935_1935" href="#Footnote_1935_1935" class="fnanchor">1935</a> “In Nanusa,” Dr. Hickson remarks, “I understood
that marriage was not permitted between members
of the same household. The enormous households of the
Nanusa archipelago are probably the remnants of a much
more complete system of intra-tribal clanships, which has
become almost obliterated in the more highly developed races
of Sangir and Siauw.”<a id="FNanchor_1936_1936" href="#Footnote_1936_1936" class="fnanchor">1936</a> Among the Nairs, a household, the
members of which are strictly prohibited from sexual relation
with each other, includes, as a rule, many allied men, women,
and children, who not only live together in large common
houses, but possess everything in common.<a id="FNanchor_1937_1937" href="#Footnote_1937_1937" class="fnanchor">1937</a> Among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Kafirs, the dimensions of a kraal are determined by the
number of a man’s family and dependants, the family consisting
of the father together with his children, including
married sons.<a id="FNanchor_1938_1938" href="#Footnote_1938_1938" class="fnanchor">1938</a></p>

<p>The South Slavonians live in house-communities, each
consisting of a body of from fifteen to sixty members or
even more, who are blood-relations to the second or third
degree, of course only on the male side.<a id="FNanchor_1939_1939" href="#Footnote_1939_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a> These related
families associate in a common dwelling or group of dwellings,
governed by a common chief. “At the present
moment,” Sir Henry Maine remarks, “the common residence
of so many persons of both sexes in the same household may
be said to be only possible through their belief that any
union of kinsmen and kinswomen would be incestuous. The
South Slavonian table of prohibited degrees is extremely
wide.”<a id="FNanchor_1940_1940" href="#Footnote_1940_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a> Again, Professor Kohler points out the connection
between the extensive prohibitions of the Hindus and their
large households.<a id="FNanchor_1941_1941" href="#Footnote_1941_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a> In Wales there existed, as a national
institution, a joint-family called “trev,” consisting of four
generations. Marriage, says Mr. Lewis, was to be “outside
the trev, or kindred who lived together within one enclosure.”<a id="FNanchor_1942_1942" href="#Footnote_1942_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a></p>

<p>Montesquieu, indeed, observed long ago that marriage
between cousins was prohibited by peoples among whom
brothers and their children used to live in the same house.
“Chez ces peuples,” he says, “le mariage entre cousins germains
doit être regardé comme contraire à la nature; chez
les autres, non.” According to him, this prohibition has the
same origin as the aversion to sexual relations between brothers
and sisters, <i>i.e.</i>, “les pères et les mères ayent voulu conserver
les mœurs de leurs enfans et leurs maisons pures.”<a id="FNanchor_1943_1943" href="#Footnote_1943_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a> Holding
a similar opinion, Dr. Bertillon maintains that, properly
speaking, it was not consanguinity, but the purity of home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
that the ancient legislators were thinking of when they forbade
close intermarriage.<a id="FNanchor_1944_1944" href="#Footnote_1944_1944" class="fnanchor">1944</a> It is scarcely necessary to say
how far I am from thinking that these prohibitions are, in the
first place, due to the providence of parents or legislators.</p>

<p>On the other hand, where the families live more separately
such extensive prohibitions to close intermarrying do not
generally exist. Among the Isánna Indians of Brazil, who
prefer marriage with relations, cousins with cousins, uncles
with nieces, and nephews with aunts, each family has a
separate house.<a id="FNanchor_1945_1945" href="#Footnote_1945_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a> The endogamous Maoris, who frequently
marry near relations, have their villages generally scattered
over a large plot of ground, the personal rights of possession
being held most sacred.<a id="FNanchor_1946_1946" href="#Footnote_1946_1946" class="fnanchor">1946</a> “There is no national bond of
union amongst them,” says Mr. Yate; “each one is jealous
of the authority and power of his neighbour; the hand of
each individual is against every man, and every man’s hand
against him.”<a id="FNanchor_1947_1947" href="#Footnote_1947_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> Among the Todas, who live in strict endogamy,
families reside in permanent villages having each a
certain tract of grazing ground around it, and containing from
two to three huts. Most of these huts consist of only one
room or cabin, and each room holds one entire subdivision of
a family.<a id="FNanchor_1948_1948" href="#Footnote_1948_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a> The Bushmans, among whom no degree of consanguinity
prevents a matrimonial connection, except between
brothers and sisters, parents and children,<a id="FNanchor_1949_1949" href="#Footnote_1949_1949" class="fnanchor">1949</a> live a
solitary life in small family huts, not high enough to admit
even of a Bushman standing upright within it.<a id="FNanchor_1950_1950" href="#Footnote_1950_1950" class="fnanchor">1950</a> As regards
the Wanyoro, whose table of prohibited degrees is unusually
small, Emin Pasha states, “Brother, sister, brother-in-law,
and son-in-law, are the recognized grades of relationship. I
have never noticed any intimate connection between more
distant relations.”<a id="FNanchor_1951_1951" href="#Footnote_1951_1951" class="fnanchor">1951</a></p>

<p>The Sinhalese, who frequently marry their cousins on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
paternal side, have from time immemorial lived either in very
small villages, consisting of a few houses, or in detached
habitations, separated from each other. Each dwelling is a
little establishment in itself, and each little village, so far as
its wants are concerned, may be considered independent.
“They seldom visit each other, except it be to beg or borrow
something. Even near relations manifest no affection to
each other in their visits, but sit with the gravity of strangers.”<a id="FNanchor_1952_1952" href="#Footnote_1952_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a></p>

<p>It is easy to explain, says Ewald, why, among the Hebrews,
marriage between brothers and sisters in the widest sense
was forbidden, while that between cousins was permitted:—“The
latter did not form one united household, and the
more each house stood strictly by itself in the ancient
fashion, the wider seemed the separation between cousins.”<a id="FNanchor_1953_1953" href="#Footnote_1953_1953" class="fnanchor">1953</a>
Tacitus states that the ancient Germans, whose prohibitions
against incest seem to have included only the nearest
relations, lived in scattered families at some distance from
each other.<a id="FNanchor_1954_1954" href="#Footnote_1954_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a> And a comparison between the forbidden
degrees of the Greeks and Romans clearly shows where
we have to seek the real cause of the prohibitions. Among
the former, even very close relationship was no hindrance to
intermarriage, whereas, among the latter, it was not allowed
between rather distantly related persons. This difference,
as Rossbach justly points out, was due to the fact that the
family feeling of the Greeks was much weaker than that of the
Romans, among whom, in early times, a son used to remain
in his father’s house even after marriage, so that cousins on
the father’s side were brought up as brothers and sisters.
Later on, the several families separated from the common
household, and the prohibited degrees were considerably
retrenched.<a id="FNanchor_1955_1955" href="#Footnote_1955_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a></p>

<p>The reader may perhaps be disposed to reproach me for
selecting only such instances as are in favour of my theory; but
statistical data will show that such an imputation would be
groundless. In speaking of the “classificatory system of
relationship,” I pointed out that this system springs, to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
great extent, from the close living together of considerable
numbers of kinsfolk. Now it is most interesting to note that
Dr. Tylor, by his method of adhesions, has found the two
institutions, exogamy and classificatory relationship, to be in
fact two sides of one institution. “In reckoning,” he says,
“from the present schedules the number of peoples who use
relationship names more or less corresponding to the classificatory
systems here considered, they are found to be fifty-three,
and the estimated number of these which might coincide
accidentally with exogamy, were there no close connection
between them, would be about twelve. But in fact the number
of peoples who have both exogamy and classification is
thirty-three, this strong coincidence being the measure of the
close casual connection subsisting between the two institutions.
The adherence is even stronger as to cross-cousin marriage
(<i>i.e.</i>, that the children of two brothers may not marry, nor the
children of two sisters, though the child of the brother may
marry the child of the sister), of which twenty-one cases
appear in the schedules, no less than fifteen of the peoples
practising it being also known as exogamous.”<a id="FNanchor_1956_1956" href="#Footnote_1956_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a> Among the
Reddies, a father’s elder brother and a mother’s elder
sister are called, respectively, “great-father” and “great
mother,” and a father’s younger brother and a mother’s
younger sister, respectively, “lesser-father” and “lesser
mother”; whereas the father’s sisters and the mother’s
brothers are denoted by quite different terms. Mr. Kearns
remarks that they consider the difference as well as the
distance of relationship between these two groups of relations
to be so great that they think it unlawful and incestuous to
marry the daughter of a father’s brother or of a mother’s
sister, she being equal to a sister, whilst it is perfectly legal
to marry the daughter of a father’s sister or of a mother’s
brother.<a id="FNanchor_1957_1957" href="#Footnote_1957_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a></p>

<p>We have seen that the prohibitions against incest are very
often more or less one-sided, applying more extensively either
to the relations on the father’s side or to those on the
mother’s, according as descent is reckoned through men or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
women. We have also seen that the line of descent is
intimately connected with local relationships; and we may
now fairly infer that the same local relationships exercise a
considerable influence on the table of prohibited degrees.
Among the Rejangs of Sumatra, says Marsden, a marriage
must not take place between relations within the third degree;
“but there are exceptions for the descendants of females who,
passing into other families, become as strangers.”<a id="FNanchor_1958_1958" href="#Footnote_1958_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a> A Chinese
woman, on marriage, alienates herself from her own family to
be incorporated into that of her husband; hence, as Mr.
Medhurst observes, children of brothers and sisters may
marry at pleasure, while those of brothers cannot be united
on pain of death.<a id="FNanchor_1959_1959" href="#Footnote_1959_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a></p>

<p>In a large number of cases, prohibitions of intermarriage
are only indirectly influenced by the close living together.
Aversion to the intermarriage of persons who live in intimate
connection with each other has provoked prohibitions
of the intermarriage of relations; and, as kinship is traced
by means of a system of names, the name comes to be
considered identical with relationship. This system, as Dr.
Tylor remarks,<a id="FNanchor_1960_1960" href="#Footnote_1960_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a> is necessarily one-sided. Though it will
keep up the record of descent either on the male or female
side, it cannot do both at once. The other line, not having
been kept up by such means of record, even where it is
recognized as a line of relationship, is more or less neglected,
and is soon forgotten; hence the prohibited degrees often
extend very far on the one side, but not on the other. We
have seen many instances of a common surname being a bar
to intermarriage. This is especially the case with peoples
among whom the clannish feeling is highly developed. Thus
even the commonest Chinese are often able to trace their
descent through lines of ancestry more remote than any that
England’s most ancient families can claim.<a id="FNanchor_1961_1961" href="#Footnote_1961_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a> And, among
the Ossetes, a man is bound to take blood-revenge for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
cousin a hundred times removed who bears his name, whereas
relationship on the mother’s side is not recognized.<a id="FNanchor_1962_1962" href="#Footnote_1962_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a></p>

<p>Generally speaking, the feeling that two persons are intimately
connected in some way or other may, through an
association of ideas, give rise to the notion that marriage or
intercourse between them is incestuous. Hence the prohibitions
of marriage between relations by alliance and by adoption.
Hence, too, the prohibitions on the ground of what is called
“spiritual relationship.” The Emperor Justinian passed a law
forbidding any man to marry a woman for whom he had stood
as godfather in baptism, the tie of the godfather and godchild
being so analogous to that of the father and child as
to make such a marriage appear improper.<a id="FNanchor_1963_1963" href="#Footnote_1963_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a> In the Roman
Church sponsorship creates a bar to the marriage even of
co-sponsors, and the restriction can be removed only by a
dispensation.<a id="FNanchor_1964_1964" href="#Footnote_1964_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a> In Eastern Europe, the groomsman at a
wedding comes under a set of rules which forbids intermarriage
with the family of the bride to exactly the same
extent as if he were naturally the brother of the bridegroom.<a id="FNanchor_1965_1965" href="#Footnote_1965_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a>
A similar <i>cognatio spiritualis</i>, according to the old
law-books of India, occurs between a pupil and his “guru,”
that is, the teacher who instructs him in the Veda. The
pupil lived in his guru’s house for several years, and regarded
him almost as a father.<a id="FNanchor_1966_1966" href="#Footnote_1966_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a> Hence adultery with a guru’s wife
was considered a mortal sin.<a id="FNanchor_1967_1967" href="#Footnote_1967_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a></p>

<p>But how, then, are we to explain the exceptions, apparent
or real, to the rule that close living together inspires an
aversion to intermarriage? How are we to explain the fact
that, besides tribes that are exogamous, there are others that
are endogamous, and that, besides peoples with very extensive
laws against intermarriage, there are others among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
whom unions take place between very near relations, such as
brothers and sisters, and even parents and children.</p>

<p>In the next chapter we shall examine the psychological
principle which underlies the endogamous marriage. For the
present it is sufficient to say that endogamy never, except in
cases of extreme isolation, seems to occur among peoples
living in very small communities with close connections
between their members. Concerning the Australians, Mr.
Curr expressly states that those tribes which are endogamous
are, as a rule, stronger in numbers than those in which
exogamous marriage obtains.<a id="FNanchor_1968_1968" href="#Footnote_1968_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a></p>

<p>The marriage of brother and sister means, as we have seen,
in most cases, marriage between a half-brother and a half-sister,
having the same father but different mothers. Such
marriages are not necessarily contrary to the principle here
laid down. Polygyny breaks up the one family into as
many sub-families as there are wives who have children, and
it is not possible for the father of these sub-families to be a
member of each of them in the same sense as the father is a
member of the monogamous family. Nor are the children
of the different mothers brought into such close contact as
the children of one mother, every wife with her own family
forming a little separate group, and generally living in a separate
hut.<a id="FNanchor_1969_1969" href="#Footnote_1969_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a> On the contrary, hatred and rivalry are of no rare
occurrence among the members of the various sub-families.
In the Pelew Islands, according to Herr Kubary, it very seldom
happens that the several wives of the same man even see
each other.<a id="FNanchor_1970_1970" href="#Footnote_1970_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a> After speaking of the marriage of half-brother
and half-sister allowed among the ancient Arabs, Professor
Robertson Smith remarks, “Whatever is the origin of bars
to marriage, they certainly are early associated with the
feeling that it is indecent for housemates to intermarry.”<a id="FNanchor_1971_1971" href="#Footnote_1971_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a></p>

<p>Most of the recorded instances of intermarriage of brother
and sister refer to royal families, to the exclusion of others;
and there is no difficulty in accounting for incestuous unions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
of this sort. Among lower races, as well as in Europe, it is
considered improper for royal persons to contract marriage
with persons of less exalted birth. But whilst European
princes may go to some friendly Court for their consorts, a
similar course is not open to African or Asiatic potentates.</p>

<p>Incestuous unions may also take place on account of
necessity, as among the Wa-taïta, or on account of extreme
isolation, as among the Karens of the Tenasserim Provinces,<a id="FNanchor_1972_1972" href="#Footnote_1972_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a>
several of the small tribes of Brazil, and especially the
Veddahs of Ceylon. Among the wild Veddahs, the different
families are separated from each other by great distances, and
it is only accidentally or occasionally that any others besides
the members of one family are brought together.<a id="FNanchor_1973_1973" href="#Footnote_1973_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a> The
reason for the practice of marrying a sister, says Professor
Virchow, “was probably the same everywhere, in the royal
families as with the naked Veddahs, the lack of suitable
women or of women altogether.”<a id="FNanchor_1974_1974" href="#Footnote_1974_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a></p>

<p>Certain instances of incestuous connection are evidently the
results of vitiated instincts, the origin of which we are not
able to trace. It is a remarkable fact that several of the
peoples among whom incestuous intercourse is said to be
practised are, at the same time, expressly stated to indulge in
bestiality or other unnatural vices.<a id="FNanchor_1975_1975" href="#Footnote_1975_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a> This shows that their
sexual feelings are altogether in a perverted state.</p>

<p>Much stress has been laid by anthropologists on the few
instances of peoples who habitually or occasionally contract
unions which we should consider criminal. They have been
taken for surviving types of the primitive condition of man,
proving that “sentiments such as those which among ourselves
restrain the sexual instincts are not innate.”<a id="FNanchor_1976_1976" href="#Footnote_1976_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a> But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
obvious that they prove nothing of the kind. Students of
early history have often paid too much regard to exceptions,
and too little to rules, overlooking the fact that there is no
rule which has no exceptions.</p>

<p>It may be objected that no feeling of incest exists among
the lower animals.<a id="FNanchor_1977_1977" href="#Footnote_1977_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> According to Mr. Huth, incest “is constantly
practised by animals, and habitually by those which
are polygamous.”<a id="FNanchor_1978_1978" href="#Footnote_1978_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a> But, as we have previously seen, among
species that live in families, the young, without exception,
leave the family as soon as they are able to shift for themselves;
and Mr. Huth has adduced not the slightest evidence for his
statement that “polygamy among animals means the closest
incest.”<a id="FNanchor_1979_1979" href="#Footnote_1979_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a></p>

<p>The hypothesis here advocated can, I think, account for all
the facts given in the last chapter. It explains how the
horror of incest may be independent of experience as well as
of education; why the horror of incest refers not only to
relations by blood, but very frequently to persons not at all
so related; why the prohibitions of consanguineous marriages
vary so considerably with regard to the prohibited
degrees, applying, however, almost universally to persons who
live in the closest contact with each other; and why these
prohibitions are so commonly extended much farther on the
one side, the paternal or the maternal, than on the other.
The question now arises:—How has this instinctive aversion to
marriage between persons living closely together originated?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen that a certain degree of similarity as regards
the reproductive system of two individuals is required to
make their union fertile and the progeny resulting from this
union fully capable of propagation. It might, then, be supposed
that the highest degree of similarity must be the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
beneficial; but in all probability this is not the case. It
seems to be necessary not only that the sexual elements which
unite shall be somewhat like, but that they shall be in some
way different. The similarity must not be <i>too</i> great.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, by his careful studies on the effects of cross-
and self-fertilization in the vegetable kingdom, contributed
more largely than any one else to the discovery of this law.
He watched, from germination to maturity, more than a
thousand individual plants, produced by crossing and self-fertilization,
belonging to fifty-seven species, fifty-two genera,
and thirty large families, and including natives of the most
various countries.<a id="FNanchor_1980_1980" href="#Footnote_1980_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a> The result established by this research
was, that cross-fertilization is generally beneficial, and self-fertilization
injurious; which is shown by the difference in
height, weight, constitutional vigour, and fertility of the offspring
from crossed and self-fertilized flowers, and in the
number of seeds produced by the parent-plants.<a id="FNanchor_1981_1981" href="#Footnote_1981_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> Hence,
whenever plants which are the offspring of self-fertilization
are opposed in the struggle for existence to the offspring of
cross-fertilization, the latter have the advantage. And this
follows, according to Mr. Darwin, from individuals of two distinct
kinds having been subjected during previous generations
to different conditions, or to their having varied from some
unknown cause in a manner commonly called spontaneous,
because of that innate tendency to vary and to advance in
organization which exists in all beings; so that in either case
their sexual elements have been in some degree differentiated.<a id="FNanchor_1982_1982" href="#Footnote_1982_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a></p>

<p>As for the animal kingdom, Mr. Darwin remarks that
almost all who have bred many kinds of animals, and have
written on the subject, have expressed the strongest conviction
on the evil effects of close interbreeding.<a id="FNanchor_1983_1983" href="#Footnote_1983_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a> “Indeed,”
says Sir J. Sebright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> “I have no doubt but that, by this
practice being continued, animals would, in course of time,
degenerate to such a degree as to become incapable of breeding
at all.... I have tried many experiments by breeding
in-and-in upon dogs, fowls, and pigeons; the dogs became,
from strong spaniels, weak and diminutive lap-dogs, the fowls
became long in the legs, small in the body, and bad breeders.”<a id="FNanchor_1984_1984" href="#Footnote_1984_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a>
Mr. Huth, on the other hand, denies that breeding in-and-in,
however close, has proved to be in itself hurtful, and quotes
the evidence of numerous breeders whose choicest stocks have
always been so bred. But in these cases, as Mr. Wallace
remarks, “there has been rigid selection by which the weak
or the infertile have been eliminated, and with such selection
there is no doubt that the ill effects of close interbreeding
can be prevented for a long time; but this by no means
proves that no ill effects are produced.”<a id="FNanchor_1985_1985" href="#Footnote_1985_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a> The consensus of
opinion on this point among eminent breeders is indeed
overwhelming, and cannot be reasoned away. According to
Crampe’s experiment with the brown rat (<i>Mus decumanus</i>),
thirty-nine animals out of 153 born by related parents, <i>i.e.</i>, 25·5
per cent., died soon after birth, whereas of 299 animals of parents
not related this was the case with twenty-eight only, <i>i.e.</i>, 8·4 per
cent. The animals of incestuous broods were much smaller and
lighter than others, and their fecundity was diminished.<a id="FNanchor_1986_1986" href="#Footnote_1986_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a> Mr.
Huth himself observed, when breeding rabbits in-and-in, that
“after the fourth generation there was a diminution of fecundity
analogous to the disgust that the stomach would feel at
the same diet long continued,” though he found no evil effect
in any other way. On the contrary, the in-and-in bred
offspring were somewhat heavier than the non-related parent
animals.<a id="FNanchor_1987_1987" href="#Footnote_1987_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a> Professor Preyer has made a similar observation
with regard to guinea-pigs: breeding in-and-in produced a
considerable loss of fertility, but was accompanied with an in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>crease
of weight.<a id="FNanchor_1988_1988" href="#Footnote_1988_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a> This seems to indicate that the effects of
close interbreeding are not always the same.</p>

<p>There are certainly breeders who prefer connecting together
the animals nearest allied in blood to one another. But, as
Dr. Mitchell observes, “when breeding in-and-in has been
practised with so-called good results, the issue is nothing but
the development of a saleable defect, which, from the animal’s
point of view, must be regarded as wholly unnatural and
artificial, and not calculated to promote its well-being or
natural usefulness.”<a id="FNanchor_1989_1989" href="#Footnote_1989_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a></p>

<p>Many writers suppose that all the evils from close interbreeding
depend upon the combination and consequent
increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents, the
state of whose health decides whether union would be favourable
or not to the offspring. “If the parents are perfectly
healthy,” says M. Pouchet, “and exempt from all commencing
degeneracy, they can only give birth to children <i>at least</i>
as healthy as themselves.... But if the same degeneracy
has already tainted both the parents, the offspring will show
it in a greater degree, and will tend towards entire disappearance.”<a id="FNanchor_1990_1990" href="#Footnote_1990_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a>
The same opinion is held by Sir John Sebright.
But being, as an experienced breeder, well aware of the injurious
results which almost always follow from interbreeding
animals too closely, he adds that, according to his belief,
there never did exist an animal without some defect, in constitution,
in form, or in some other essential quality, or that
at least a tendency to the same imperfection generally prevails
in the same family.<a id="FNanchor_1991_1991" href="#Footnote_1991_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a></p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, however, has shown it to be highly probable
that, though the injury has often partly resulted from the
combination of morbid tendencies, the general cause is
different. Considering the number of self-fertilized plants
that were tried, he thinks it is nothing less than absurd to
suppose that in all these cases the mother-plants, though not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
appearing in any way diseased, were weak or unhealthy in so
peculiar a manner that their self-fertilized seedlings, many
hundreds in number, were rendered inferior in height, weight,
constitutional vigour, and fertility to their crossed offspring.<a id="FNanchor_1992_1992" href="#Footnote_1992_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a>
Moreover, self-fertilization and close interbreeding induce
sterility, and this indicates something quite different from the
augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents.<a id="FNanchor_1993_1993" href="#Footnote_1993_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a>
Hence it seems to be almost beyond doubt that, just as the
sterility of distinct species when first crossed, and of their
hybrid offspring, depends on their sexual elements having
been differentiated in too great a degree, the evils of close
interbreeding, or self-fertilization in plants, result chiefly
from their sexual elements not having been sufficiently
differentiated. But we do not know why a certain
amount of differentiation is necessary or favourable for
the fertilization or union of two organisms, any more than for
the chemical affinity or union of two substances.<a id="FNanchor_1994_1994" href="#Footnote_1994_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a> It must, however,
be observed that no case of complete sterility is met with in
self-fertilized seedlings, as is so common with hybrids,<a id="FNanchor_1995_1995" href="#Footnote_1995_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a> and
that interbreeding even of the nearest relations may sometimes,
under very favourable circumstances, be continued
through several generations without any evil results making
their appearance.</p>

<p>It is impossible to believe that a law which holds good for
the rest of the animal kingdom, as well as for plants, does
not apply to man also. But it is difficult to adduce direct
evidence for the evil effects of consanguineous marriages. We
cannot expect very conspicuous results from other alliances
than those between the nearest relations—between brothers
and sisters, parents and children. And the injurious results
even of such unions would not necessarily appear at once.
Sir J. Sebright remarks that there may be families of
domestic animals which go through several generations
without sustaining much injury from having been bred in-and-in,<a id="FNanchor_1996_1996" href="#Footnote_1996_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a>
and the offspring of self-fertilized plants do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
always show any loss of vigour in the first generations. Man
cannot, in this respect, be subjected to experiments like those
tried in the case of other animals, and habitual intermarriage
of the very nearest relations is, as we have seen, exceedingly
rare. Mr. Adam argues that there is no proof of the physical
deterioration of those divisions of mankind amongst whom
incestuous unions are known more or less to have prevailed—as
the Egyptians and Persians.<a id="FNanchor_1997_1997" href="#Footnote_1997_1997" class="fnanchor">1997</a> But among these nations
marriage certainly did not always take place between closely
related persons; and breeders of domestic animals inform us
that the mixing-in even of a drop of unrelated blood is sufficient
almost to neutralize the injurious effects of long continued
close interbreeding. Again, Mr. Huth asserts that,
though the Ptolemies habitually married their sisters, nieces,
and cousins, they were neither sterile nor particularly short-lived.<a id="FNanchor_1998_1998" href="#Footnote_1998_1998" class="fnanchor">1998</a>
Mr. Galton, on the contrary, sees in Ptolemaic experience
a proof that close intermarriage is followed by
sterility.<a id="FNanchor_1999_1999" href="#Footnote_1999_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> In ten marriages between brothers and sisters,
uncles and nieces, or between first-cousins, the average number
of children was not quite two, and three of the unions were
entirely sterile.<a id="FNanchor_2000_2000" href="#Footnote_2000_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a></p>

<p>The Veddahs of Ceylon are probably the most in-and-in
bred people that ever existed. Among them, the practice of
a man marrying his younger sister did not occur only
occasionally; according to Mr. Bailey, it was <i>the</i> proper
marriage. Among the Bintenne Veddahs, it may be said to
have been, for perhaps two generations or so, extinct, whilst
among those of Nilgala, it is at most only disappearing. Mr.
Bailey believes that this practice is quite sufficient to account
for the short stature as well as the weak and vacant expression
of this people. He did not find many traces of insanity,
idiocy, and epilepsy—maladies which such marriages, according
to a common belief, might be supposed to produce.
“But in other respects,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span> “the injurious effects of this
custom would seem to be plainly discernible. The race is
rapidly becoming extinct; large families are all but unknown,
and longevity is very rare. I have been at some pains to
obtain reliable data to elucidate these points. Out of
seventy-two Veddahs in Nilgala, fifty were adults, and
twenty-two children. In one small sept, or family, there
were nine adults and one child; in another, one child and
eight adults; and so on. In Bintenne, out of three hundred
and eight Veddahs, a hundred and seventy-five were adults
and a hundred and thirty-three children. Here the disproportion
is not so marked; but in one of the smaller
tribes, more isolated than the rest, there were twenty adults,
and but four children. The paucity of children, I think,
must be ascribed to the degeneracy produced by such close
intermarriages, for I have never heard a suspicion of infanticide
existing among them. Out of fifty adults in Nilgala,
only one appeared to have numbered seventy years, and but
eight to have exceeded fifty. In Bintenne, of a hundred
and seventy-five adults, two only seemed to have reached
their seventieth, and but fourteen to have exceeded their
fiftieth year. Such statistics seem to show the practical
results of such connections. The Nilgala Veddahs, who still
maintain an almost total isolation from other people, are
rapidly disappearing. The Veddahs of Bintenne, who have
abandoned the pernicious custom which I have described,
and still intermarry among themselves, are becoming extinct,
though more gradually.”<a id="FNanchor_2001_2001" href="#Footnote_2001_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a></p>

<p>With the exception of this case, the closest kind of
intermarriage which we have opportunities of studying is
that between first cousins. Unfortunately, the observations
hitherto made on the subject are far from decisive. Several
writers, as M. Périer, Dr. Voisin, and Mr. Huth, believe that
there are no injurious results at all from those marriages,
unless the parents are afflicted with the same hereditary
morbid tendencies,<a id="FNanchor_2002_2002" href="#Footnote_2002_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a> whilst others, as M. Devay and M.
Boudin, express the most alarming opinions as to the bad
effects of consanguineous marriages. Such alliances are supposed
to bring evils of many different kinds upon a popu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>lation,
as sterility, idiocy, epilepsy, insanity, deaf-muteism,
congenital malformations in the offspring, cretinism, albinoism,<a id="FNanchor_2003_2003" href="#Footnote_2003_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a>
&amp;c. But how little the statements of the various writers
agree with each other appears, for instance, from the fact
that M. Boudin found the proportion of deaf-mutes born in
consanguineous marriages, in the Imperial Institution of
Deaf-Mutes at Paris, to be 28·35 per cent., whereas, according
to Dr. Mitchell, it amounts to 5·17 per cent. in Scotch
and English institutions.<a id="FNanchor_2004_2004" href="#Footnote_2004_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a></p>

<p>As it is impossible to dwell here upon the investigations of
the several writers, of which Mr. Huth has given so complete
an account, I shall confine myself to a statement of the
general results attained by those investigators who have
founded their inquiries on a more trustworthy statistical
basis.</p>

<p>Adopting a method different from that of his predecessors,
Professor G. H. Darwin has endeavoured first to discover
the proportion of consanguineous marriages in the whole
population, and then to find out whether the offspring of
those marriages exhibit a greater percentage of individuals,
defective in one way or another, than the offspring of non-consanguineous
marriages. His investigations tend decidedly
to invalidate the exaggerated conclusions of many previous
writers, but he thinks that “there are nevertheless grounds
for asserting that various maladies take an easy hold of the
offspring of consanguineous marriages.”<a id="FNanchor_2005_2005" href="#Footnote_2005_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a> He did not find
evidence that the marriage of first cousins had any effect in the
production of infertility, deaf-muteism, insanity, or idiocy, but
he observed a slightly lowered vitality amongst the offspring
of first cousins, and a somewhat higher death-rate than
amongst the families of non-consanguineous marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2006_2006" href="#Footnote_2006_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a>
Moreover, the numbers of boating men belonging to the
twenty boats at Oxford and thirty at Cambridge, in the first
and second division, and those of selected athletes from some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
schools in England, justified, to some extent, the belief
“that offspring of first cousins are deficient physically,
whilst at the same time they negative the views of alarmist
writers on the subject.”<a id="FNanchor_2007_2007" href="#Footnote_2007_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a> It is curious that, in spite of such
unambiguous statements, Mr. Darwin’s paper has generally
been quoted as an evidence of the perfect harmlessness of
first cousin marriages.</p>

<p>M. Stieda has found that, in the departments of France, the
number of bodily or mentally infirm people increases almost
constantly in proportion to the number of consanguineous
marriages, as will be seen from the following table:—</p>

<p>The Danish physician, Dr. Mygge, published in 1879 a
book on ‛Marriage between Blood-Relations,’ which unfortunately
has received much less attention than it deserves.<a id="FNanchor_2009_2009" href="#Footnote_2009_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a>
Thanks to the trustworthiness of the method, the number of
cases considered, and the author’s impartiality, it is probably
the most important statistical contribution hitherto issued on
this subject. Dr. Mygge found, from the information he
received from various parts of Denmark, that in that country,
or at least in the parishes of it which came under his observation,
there occur, among the children of related persons,
comparatively more idiots, lunatics, epileptics, and deaf-mutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
than among others. He considers it probable, too, though
not proved, that such children die in a higher ratio and are
more liable to certain diseases. But, on the other hand, he
did not notice any perceptible difference in fertility between
consanguineous and crossed marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2010_2010" href="#Footnote_2010_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a></p>

<p>In these inquiries, Dr. Mygge followed the method applied by
the Norwegian physician Ludvig Dahl twenty years earlier.
Through careful investigation of 246 marriages, eighty-five of
which were between first cousins and four between still nearer
relations, this inquirer was led to the conclusions that consanguineous
marriages are somewhat less fertile than crossed
marriages; that they produce comparatively many more still-born
and sickly children; and that insanity, idiocy, deaf-dumbness,
and epilepsy occur about eleven times as often
among the offspring of relations, as among the offspring
of unrelated parents. But he admitted that the numbers
compared were too small to make his conclusions decisive.<a id="FNanchor_2011_2011" href="#Footnote_2011_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a></p>

<p>These results are of course to a great extent conjectural.
But it is noteworthy that, of all the writers who have
discussed the subject, the majority, and certainly not the
least able of them, have expressed their belief in marriages
between first cousins being more or less unfavourable to the
offspring.<a id="FNanchor_2012_2012" href="#Footnote_2012_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a> And no evidence which can stand the test of
scientific investigation has hitherto been adduced against
this view.</p>

<p>Some writers have, indeed, cited instances of communities
where consanguineous marriages have occurred constantly
without any evil effects having appeared. Thus the Pitcairn
Island, uninhabited till the year 1790, was at that time
peopled by nine white men, and six men and twelve women
of Tahiti. In 1800 the population consisted of one man, five
women, and nineteen children; and the descendants of these
persons are stated by later travellers to be strong and healthy
without any traces of degeneration. Omitting whatever else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
may be said against this case as evidence for the harmlessness
of consanguineous marriages, I need only call attention
to the facts that, since the colonization of this island, a few
strangers have joined the little colony; that it was once
removed to Norfolk Island, and that, of those who returned,
one was a Norfolk Islander who had married a Pitcairn girl;
that the island has frequently been visited by ships with
their crews;<a id="FNanchor_2013_2013" href="#Footnote_2013_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a> and that, as Beechey expressly states, the same
restrictions with regard to intermarriage of relations exist here
as in England.<a id="FNanchor_2014_2014" href="#Footnote_2014_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a></p>

<p>There are several isolated communities—in Java, Peru,
Great Britain, France, Scandinavia, &amp;c.—which intermarry
solely among themselves without any evil effects being discernible.
An often-quoted case is the community of Batz
(3,300 persons), situated near Croisic on a peninsula. The
inhabitants of this community have been in the habit of closely
intermarrying among themselves from time immemorial.
Nevertheless, they are almost all very well in health without
any hereditary affection. But Dr. Voisin observes, “Les conditions
climatériques de la commune de Batz, son voisinage de
la mer, l’hygiène et les habitudes de ses habitants, semblent
s’accorder pour empêcher la dégénérescence de l’espèce et
paraissent expliquer l’innocuité des mariages entre consanguins
qui s’y pratiquent depuis plusieurs siècles.”<a id="FNanchor_2015_2015" href="#Footnote_2015_2015" class="fnanchor">2015</a> In other
isolated communities the population is not so numerous, and
the sanitary conditions are not perhaps so favourable: but in
any case we may say that this local endogamy is generally
something quite different from marriage with near relations.
Dr. Mitchell found that, in almost all the isolated communities
along the coasts of Scotland, which had been given as instances
of close interbreeding, such marriages were comparatively
rare. According to Dr. Mygge, the like is true of the
population of Lyø and Strynø in Denmark.<a id="FNanchor_2016_2016" href="#Footnote_2016_2016" class="fnanchor">2016</a> And Dr. Andrew
Wood states, of the fisher-folk of Newhaven, that, though they
keep themselves much segregated, they are very careful regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>ing
intermarriage, and look upon the union of relatives as an
infringement of the laws of morality.<a id="FNanchor_2017_2017" href="#Footnote_2017_2017" class="fnanchor">2017</a></p>

<p>Moreover, even if it could be proved that, in particular cases,
close intermarrying, though continued for a long time, has
been followed by no bad consequences, this would be no
evidence that consanguineous marriages are as a rule innocuous.
In some parishes of Denmark Dr. Mygge found no evil effects
of such marriages, whilst in others they were very conspicuous.<a id="FNanchor_2018_2018" href="#Footnote_2018_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a>
And from the investigations of Mr. Darwin it appears that,
notwithstanding the injury which most plants suffer from self-fertilization,
a few have almost certainly been propagated in a
state of nature for thousands of generations without having
been once intercrossed. It is impossible to understand, he
says, why some individuals even of the <i>same species</i> are sterile,
whilst others are quite fertile, with their own pollen.<a id="FNanchor_2019_2019" href="#Footnote_2019_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a></p>

<p>There is evidence that the bad consequences of self-fertilization
and close interbreeding may almost fail to appear
under favourable conditions of life. In-and-in bred plants,
when allowed enough space and good soil, frequently show
little or no deterioration: whereas, when placed in competition
with another plant, they often perish or are much stunted.<a id="FNanchor_2020_2020" href="#Footnote_2020_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a>
Crampe’s experiments with brown rats proved that the breeding
in-and-in was much less injurious, if the offspring of the
related parents were well fed and taken care of, than if it
was otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_2021_2021" href="#Footnote_2021_2021" class="fnanchor">2021</a> And this is in striking accordance with
Dr. Mitchell’s observations as to consanguineous marriages
in Scotland. The results there appear to be least grave, and
are frequently almost <i>nil</i>, if the parents and children live in
tolerable comfort, without anxiety or much thought for the
morrow, and easily earning enough to procure good food and
clothing—in short, when they work, but do not struggle for
existence. On the other hand, when they are “poor, pinched
for food, scrimp of clothing, badly housed, and exposed to
misery; when they have to toil and struggle for the bare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
necessaries of life—never having enough for to-day and being
always fearful of to-morrow,”—the evil may become very
marked.<a id="FNanchor_2022_2022" href="#Footnote_2022_2022" class="fnanchor">2022</a></p>

<p>If this is the case, we must expect to find that consanguineous
marriages are much more injurious in savage regions,
where the struggle for existence is often very severe, than
they have proved to be in civilized society, especially as it is
among the well-off classes that such marriages occur most
frequently.<a id="FNanchor_2023_2023" href="#Footnote_2023_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a> In England, according to Mr. G. H. Darwin,
cousin-marriages among the aristocracy are probably 4½ per
cent.; among the middle and upper middle class, or among
the landed gentry, 3½ per cent.; but in London, comprising
all classes, they are probably only 1½ per cent.<a id="FNanchor_2024_2024" href="#Footnote_2024_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a> He thinks
that the slightness of the evils which he found to result
from first-cousin marriages perhaps depends upon the fact
that a large majority of Englishmen live under what are on
the whole very favourable circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_2025_2025" href="#Footnote_2025_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> We must also,
however, remember that there has been a great mixture of
races in Europe, and that this necessarily makes marriage of
kinsfolk less injurious, so far as the evil results of such unions
depend upon too great a likeness between the sexual elements.</p>

<p>The conclusion that closely related marriages produce
more destructive effects among savage than civilized peoples,
derives perhaps, some additional probability from certain
ethnological facts. These facts may, at least, serve to show
that such marriages, and the experience of isolated communities,
are not everywhere in favour of Mr. Huth’s conclusions.
Several statements on the subject have, indeed, scarcely any
value as direct evidence for the harmfulness of consanguineous
marriages, but to two or three considerable weight must
be attached.</p>

<p>According to v. Martius, who is a great authority on
Brazilian ethnography, it is a well-established fact, observed
everywhere, that the smaller and more isolated of the Indian
communities, scarcely any members of which marry members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
of other communities, are much more liable to every kind of
deterioration than the larger groups.<a id="FNanchor_2026_2026" href="#Footnote_2026_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> “It is probable,” Mr.
Bates, another most capable judge, remarks with reference to
the savage tribes on the Upper Amazons, “that the strange
inflexibility of the Indian organization, both bodily and
mental, is owing to the isolation in which each small tribe has
lived, and to the narrow round of life and thought, and close
intermarriages for countless generations, which are the
necessary results. Their fecundity is of a low degree, for it
is very rare to find an Indian family having so many as four
children, and we have seen how great is their liability to
sickness and death on removal from place to place.”<a id="FNanchor_2027_2027" href="#Footnote_2027_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> Touching
the Isánna Indians, Mr. Wallace asserts that they are said
not to be nearly so numerous, nor to increase so rapidly, as
the Uaupés; which may perhaps be owing to their marrying
with relations, while the latter prefer strangers.<a id="FNanchor_2028_2028" href="#Footnote_2028_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a> And
v. Tschudi supposes that the low fecundity of the Botocudos
is caused by their endogamous habits; for when their women
marry out of their own horde, especially with whites or
negroes, they are generally very fertile.<a id="FNanchor_2029_2029" href="#Footnote_2029_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a></p>

<p>The Calidonian Indians of the Isthmus of Darien, according
to Mr. Gisborne, are bound never to cross the breed
with foreigners; hence intermarriage is very constant, and,
as he remarks, the race degenerates.<a id="FNanchor_2030_2030" href="#Footnote_2030_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> The Pueblos in New
Mexico, too, are said to deteriorate because of their constant
intermarriage in the same village.<a id="FNanchor_2031_2031" href="#Footnote_2031_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> As regards the Hottentots,
Barrow remarks, “The impolitic custom of hording
together in families, and of not marrying out of their own
kraals, has no doubt tended to enervate this race of men, and
reduced them to their present degenerated condition, which is
that of a languid, listless phlegmatic people, in whom the prolific
powers of nature seem to be almost exhausted.” Few of
the women have more than two or three children, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
of them are barren. But this is not the case when a Hottentot
woman is connected with a white man. “The fruit of such an
alliance,” says Barrow, “is not only in general numerous, but
they are beings of a very different nature from the Hottentot.”<a id="FNanchor_2032_2032" href="#Footnote_2032_2032" class="fnanchor">2032</a></p>

<p>In too early marriages, the licentious habits of both sexes,
and the intermarriage of near relatives, the Rev. J. Sibree finds
the causes of the infertility of the women of Madagascar.<a id="FNanchor_2033_2033" href="#Footnote_2033_2033" class="fnanchor">2033</a>
Among the Garos, the chiefs have, in comparison with the
lower classes, degenerated physically, and Colonel Dalton is
inclined to think that this degeneration is a result of close
interbreeding.<a id="FNanchor_2034_2034" href="#Footnote_2034_2034" class="fnanchor">2034</a> The Lundu Sea Dyaks, according to Sir
Spenser St. John, have decreased greatly in numbers—from
a thousand families to ten. “They complain bitterly,” he
says, “that they have no families, that their women are not
fertile; indeed, there were but three or four children in the
whole place. The men were fine-looking and the women
well-favoured and healthy—remarkably clean and free from
disease. We could only account for their decreasing numbers
by their constant intermarriages.”<a id="FNanchor_2035_2035" href="#Footnote_2035_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a> Mr. Foreman thinks that
the low intellect and mental debility perceptible in many
families among the domesticated natives of the Philippines are
due to consanguineous marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2036_2036" href="#Footnote_2036_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a> Mr. Bachelor connects the
rapid decrease of the Ainos with their endogamous habits.<a id="FNanchor_2037_2037" href="#Footnote_2037_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a>
And Mr. Meade remarks, with regard to the Maoris, that one
of the principal causes of the diminishing population is said
to be their intermarriages, which cause barrenness among the
women.<a id="FNanchor_2038_2038" href="#Footnote_2038_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a></p>

<p>Of no little interest to us are the Todas of the Neilgherry
Hills. Mr. Marshall remarks that, among them, relationship
is intimate far beyond that witnessed in any country approaching
civilization—“intimate to such a degree, that the whole
tribe, where not parents and children, brothers and sisters,
are all first cousins, descended from lines of first cousins prolonged
for centuries.”<a id="FNanchor_2039_2039" href="#Footnote_2039_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a> As regards the general appearance
of the people, a large proportion of both sexes and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
all ages are doubtless in excellent health, and their fecundity,
according to Dr. Shortt, is by no means of a low degree.<a id="FNanchor_2040_2040" href="#Footnote_2040_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a>
Nevertheless, the Todas are dying out. In infancy the mortality
is so great that, as a rule, there is in each family only
a small number of children.<a id="FNanchor_2041_2041" href="#Footnote_2041_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> “It is rarely that there are
more than two or three children,” says the missionary Metz,
“and it is not at all an uncommon thing to find only a single
child, while many families have none at all.” The numbers of
the Todas have, consequently, for years past been gradually
declining, and probably the time is not far distant when they
will have passed away.<a id="FNanchor_2042_2042" href="#Footnote_2042_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a> Of course, we do not know whether
this depends upon their close intermarriages, but there is, at
any rate, some reason to suspect that this is the case. That
the intermarrying has not produced more evil effects on the
population, may possibly be owing to the wealth for which the
Neilgherry Hills are remarkable, and to their climate, which,
for mildly invigorating properties and equable seasonal changes
throughout the year, is perhaps unrivalled anywhere within
the tropics.<a id="FNanchor_2043_2043" href="#Footnote_2043_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a></p>

<p>Another very much in-and-in bred people are the Persians.
Among them, husband and wife are generally of the same
family, and very often cousins. Yet Dr. Polak who has lived
in Persia for nine years, partly as a teacher in the medical
school of Teheran, partly as physician to the Shah, and
during this residence has had excellent opportunities of
acquainting himself with the conditions of the people, has not
observed that the diseases which are supposed to result from
consanguineous marriages prevail more frequently there than
elsewhere. Nor has he found that the Persian women are
generally less fertile than others. Yet the families are
exceedingly small, as the mortality among children is enormous.
Of six, perhaps two as a rule survive, but very often
none at all, most of them dying in their second year. Dr.
Polak believes, indeed, that, on an average, scarcely more
than one living child comes to each woman. A princess in
Teheran was looked upon quite as a wonder because she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
eight children alive, and the European physician was asked
if he ever before, in his own country, had seen a similar
case.<a id="FNanchor_2044_2044" href="#Footnote_2044_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a></p>

<p>More important than any of these statements is the following
testimony concerning the Karens of Burma, for which I
am indebted to the Rev. Dr. Alonzo Bunker, who has been a
resident among that people during more than twenty years.
He says that, in some of their villages, exogamy prevails, in
others endogamy, but marriages between parents and children,
brothers and sisters, are prohibited everywhere, and even
first cousins very seldom marry, though there is no law
against such connections. There is a striking difference with
regard to stature, health, strength and fecundity, between the
inhabitants of the exogamous and those of the endogamous
villages, the latter being much inferior in all these respects.
Dr. Bunker has no doubt that this inferiority is owing to the
intermarriage of kinsfolk, and he asserts that even the natives
themselves ascribe it to this cause, though they obstinately
keep up the old custom, regarding marriages out of their own
village as highly unbecoming. In cases in which missionaries
have been able to persuade young men to choose wives from
another village, Dr. Bunker assures me that the good effects
of a cross appeared at once.<a id="FNanchor_2045_2045" href="#Footnote_2045_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a></p>

<p>There are some other peoples who ascribe evil results to
close intermarriage. Mr. Cousins informs me that the Cis-Natalian
Kafirs believe “that their offspring would be of a
more sickly nature if such were allowed”; and Mr. Eyles
writes that the Zulus, on the border of Pondoland, regard
sterility and deformity as consequences of consanguineous
unions. The Australian Dieyerie, according to Mr. Gason,
have a tradition that, after the creation, fathers, mothers,
sisters, brothers, and others of the closest kin intermarried
promiscuously, until the bad effects of these marriages became
manifest. A council of the chiefs was then assembled to
consider in what way the evil might be averted, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
result of their deliberations was a petition to the Muramura,
or Good Spirit. In answer to this he ordered that the tribe
should be divided into branches, and distinguished one from
the other by different names, after objects animate and inanimate,
such as dogs, mice, emu, rain, and so forth, and
that the members of any such branch should be forbidden to
marry other members of the same branch.<a id="FNanchor_2046_2046" href="#Footnote_2046_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> Again, touching
the Kenai, in the north-western part of North America,
Richardson states, “It was the custom that the men of one
stock should choose their wives from another, and the offspring
belonged to the race of the mother. This custom has
fallen into disuse, and marriages in the same tribe occur; but
the old people say that mortality among the Kenai has arisen
from the neglect of the ancient usage.”<a id="FNanchor_2047_2047" href="#Footnote_2047_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a></p>

<p>In a Greenland Eskimo tale, the father of Kakamak, finding
that all his grandchildren have died before reaching the
age of puberty, suggests to his son-in-law, “Perhaps we are
too near akin.”<a id="FNanchor_2048_2048" href="#Footnote_2048_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> Two Mohammedan travellers of the ninth
century tell us that the Hindus never married a relation,
because they thought alliances between unrelated persons
improved the offspring.<a id="FNanchor_2049_2049" href="#Footnote_2049_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a> In Hadîth, the collection of
Mohammedan traditions, it is said, “Marry among strangers;
thus you will not have feeble posterity.” “This view,” says
Goldziher, “coincides with the opinion of the ancient Arabs
that the children of endogamous marriages are weakly and
lean. To this class also belongs the proverb of Al-Meydânî,
‘ ... Marry the distant, marry not the near’ (in relationship).”
A poet, praising a hero, says, “He is a hero, not
borne by the cousin (of his father), he is not weakly; for the
seed of relations brings forth feeble fruit.”<a id="FNanchor_2050_2050" href="#Footnote_2050_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a></p>

<p>In opposition to the view that these opinions are the
results of experience, it may be urged that any infraction of
the customs or laws of ancestors is commonly thought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
call down divine vengeance. Father Veniaminof tells us
that, among the early Aleuts, incest, which was considered
the gravest crime, was believed to be always followed by the
birth of monsters with walrus-tusks, beard, and other disfiguration;<a id="FNanchor_2051_2051" href="#Footnote_2051_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a>
and among the Kafirs, according to Mr. Fynn, it
is a general belief that the offspring of an incestuous union
will be a monster—“a punishment inflicted by the ancestral
spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_2052_2052" href="#Footnote_2052_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a> But whatever may be said of the other cases referred
to, no such explanation can possibly hold good for the Arabs.
Among them, marriage with a near relation involved no infringement
of their marriage regulations. On the contrary,
in spite of the opinions in favour of exogamy, the preference
for marriage with a cousin was dominant among them, and a
man had even a right to the hand of his “bint ‘amm,” the
daughter of a paternal uncle.<a id="FNanchor_2053_2053" href="#Footnote_2053_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a></p>

<p>Taking all these facts into consideration, I cannot but
believe that consanguineous marriages, in some way or other,
are more or less detrimental to the species. And here, I
think, we may find a quite sufficient explanation of the horror
of incest; not because man at an early stage recognized the
injurious influence of close intermarriage, but because the law
of natural selection must inevitably have operated. Among
the ancestors of man, as among other animals, there was no
doubt a time when blood-relationship was no bar to sexual
intercourse. But variations, here as elsewhere, would naturally
present themselves; and those of our ancestors who avoided
in-and-in breeding would survive, while the others would
gradually decay and ultimately perish. Thus an instinct
would be developed which would be powerful enough, as a
rule, to prevent injurious unions. Of course it would display
itself simply as an aversion on the part of individuals to union
with others with whom they lived; but these, as a matter of
fact, would be blood-relations, so that the result would be the
survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>Whether man inherited the feeling from the predecessors
from whom he sprang, or whether it was developed after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
the evolution of distinctly human qualities, we do not know.
It must necessarily have arisen at a stage when family ties
became comparatively strong, and children remained with
their parents until the age of puberty, or even longer. Exogamy,
as a natural extension of this instinct, would arise
when single families united in small hordes. It could not
but grow up if the idea of union between persons intimately
associated with one another was an object of innate repugnance.
There is no real reason why we should assume, as so
many anthropologists have done,<a id="FNanchor_2054_2054" href="#Footnote_2054_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a> that primitive men lived in
small endogamous communities, practising incest in every
degree. The theory does not accord with what is known of
the customs of existing savages; and it accounts for no facts
which may not be otherwise far more satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>The objection will perhaps be made that the aversion to
sexual intercourse between persons living very closely together
from early youth is too complicated a mental phenomenon to
be a true instinct, acquired through spontaneous variations
intensified by natural selection. But there are instincts just
as complicated as this feeling, which, in fact, only implies
that disgust is associated with the idea of sexual intercourse
between persons who have lived in a long-continued, intimate
relationship from a period of life at which the action of desire
is naturally out of the question. This association is no
matter of course, and certainly cannot be explained by the
mere liking for novelty. It has all the characteristics of a
real, powerful instinct, and bears evidently a close resemblance
to the aversion to sexual intercourse with individuals
belonging to another species.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides the horror of incest, there is another feeling to
which reference may here be made. “L’amour,” says Bernardin
de Saint-Pierre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> “ ... ne résulte que des contrastes;
et plus ils sont grands, plus il a d’énergie. C’est ce que je
pourrois prouver par mille traits d’histoire.... L’influence
des contrastes en amour est si certaine, qu’en voyant l’amant
on peut faire le portrait de l’objet aimé sans l’avoir vu, pourvu
qu’on sache seulement qu’il est affecté d’une forte passion.”<a id="FNanchor_2055_2055" href="#Footnote_2055_2055" class="fnanchor">2055</a>
Schopenhauer likewise observes that every person requires
from the individual of the opposite sex a one-sidedness which
is the opposite of his or her own. The most manly man
will seek the most womanly woman, and <i>vice versa</i>. Weak
or little men have a decided inclination for strong or big
women, and strong or big women for weak or little men.
Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; snub-nosed persons,
hook-nosed; persons with excessively slim, long bodies
and limbs, those who are stumpy and short; and so on.<a id="FNanchor_2056_2056" href="#Footnote_2056_2056" class="fnanchor">2056</a> A
similar view is held by M. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Alexander
Walker, Professor Mantegazza, Mr. Grant Allen, and other
writers.<a id="FNanchor_2057_2057" href="#Footnote_2057_2057" class="fnanchor">2057</a> “In the love of the sexes,” says Professor Bain, “the
charm of disparity goes beyond the standing differences of
sex; as in contrasts of complexion, and of stature.”<a id="FNanchor_2058_2058" href="#Footnote_2058_2058" class="fnanchor">2058</a></p>

<p>Some writers have suggested that love thus excited by
differences is favourable to fecundity, those marriages in
which it exists being more prolific than others.<a id="FNanchor_2059_2059" href="#Footnote_2059_2059" class="fnanchor">2059</a> Thus Mr.
Andrew Knight, a most experienced breeder, remarks, “I am
disposed to think that the most powerful human minds will
be found offspring of parents of different hereditary constitutions.
I prefer a male of a different colour from the breed
of the female, where that can be obtained, and I think that
I have seen fine children produced in more than one instance,
where one family has been dark and the other fair. I am
sure that I have witnessed the bad effects of marriages
between two individuals very similar to each other in character
and colour, and springing from ancestry of similar character.
Such have appeared to me to be like marriages between
brothers and sisters.”<a id="FNanchor_2060_2060" href="#Footnote_2060_2060" class="fnanchor">2060</a></p>

<p>These statements, of course, prove nothing, but they may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
perhaps derive some value from the fact that they are made
by so many different observers. The statistical investigation
of Professor Alphonse de Candolle, bearing upon the same
question, rests on firmer ground. He has found, from facts
collected in Switzerland, North Germany, and Belgium, that
marriages are most commonly contracted between persons
with different colours of the eye, except in the case of brown-eyed
women, who are generally considered more attractive
than others.<a id="FNanchor_2061_2061" href="#Footnote_2061_2061" class="fnanchor">2061</a> He has noted, further, that the number of
children is considerably smaller in families where the parents
have the same colour of the eye than where the reverse is
the case.<a id="FNanchor_2062_2062" href="#Footnote_2062_2062" class="fnanchor">2062</a> But Professor Wittrock could not, in Sweden, find
any such difference in fecundity between the two categories
of marriages;<a id="FNanchor_2063_2063" href="#Footnote_2063_2063" class="fnanchor">2063</a> and Mr. Galton observes, “Whatever may be
the sexual preferences for similarity or for contrast, I find
little indication in the average results obtained from a fairly
large number of cases, of any single measurable personal
peculiarity, whether it be stature, temper, eye-colour or
artistic tastes, influencing marriage selection to a notable
degree.”<a id="FNanchor_2064_2064" href="#Footnote_2064_2064" class="fnanchor">2064</a></p>

<p>If contrasts instinctively seek each other, this may partly
account for the readiness with which love awakens love.
Every one knows some unhappy lover who has never been
able to win the heart of the person he adores; but in most
cases, I should say, love is mutual. And this, perhaps, is
owing not only to the contagiousness of the passion, but
also to the attractive power of contrasts, which acts equally
upon both parties. Thus we might explain, to some extent,
the extreme variation of tastes, and the fact that, besides the
general standard of beauty common to the whole race, there
exists a more detailed ideal special to each individual.</p>

SYMPATHY, AND BY CALCULATION</small></h2>


<p>Sexual love is the passion which unites the sexes. The
stimulating impressions produced by health, youth, and
beauty, and ornaments and other artificial means of attraction,
are all elements of this feeling. The antipathy to
sexual intercourse with individuals of another species, and
the horror of incest, belong to the same phenomenon. But
the psychology of love is by no means exhausted by this.
“Simple et primitif comme toutes les forces colossales,” says
Professor Mantegazza, “l’amour paraît pourtant formé des
éléments de toutes les passions humaines.”<a id="FNanchor_2065_2065" href="#Footnote_2065_2065" class="fnanchor">2065</a> Around the
sexual appetite as the leading element there are aggregated
many different feelings, such as admiration, pleasure of possession,
love of freedom, self-esteem, and love of approbation.<a id="FNanchor_2066_2066" href="#Footnote_2066_2066" class="fnanchor">2066</a>
A complete analysis of love would fill a volume. Here I
shall discuss only one of the most important elements of this
highly compound feeling, the sentiment of affection.</p>

<p>In the lower stages of human development sexual affection
is much inferior in intensity to the tender feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
with which parents embrace their children; and among
several peoples it seems to be almost unknown. Thus,
speaking of the Hovas in Madagascar, Mr. Sibree says
that, among them, until the spread of Christianity, there
was “no lack of strong affection between blood-relations—parents
and children, brothers and sisters, grandparents and
grandchildren;” but the idea of love between husband and
wife was hardly thought of.<a id="FNanchor_2067_2067" href="#Footnote_2067_2067" class="fnanchor">2067</a> On the Gold Coast, says Major
Ellis, “love, as understood by the people of Europe, has
no existence.”<a id="FNanchor_2068_2068" href="#Footnote_2068_2068" class="fnanchor">2068</a> At Winnebah, according to Mr. Duncan,
“not even the appearance of affection exists between husband
and wife;” and almost the same is asserted by M. Sabatier
with reference to the Kabyles, by Signor Bonfanti with
reference to the Bantu race.<a id="FNanchor_2069_2069" href="#Footnote_2069_2069" class="fnanchor">2069</a> Munzinger says that, among
the Beni-Amer, it is considered even disgraceful for a wife to
show any affection for her husband.<a id="FNanchor_2070_2070" href="#Footnote_2070_2070" class="fnanchor">2070</a> The Chittagong Hill
tribes, according to Captain Lewin, have “no idea of tenderness,
nor of chivalrous devotion.” Marriage is among them
regarded as merely a convenient and animal connection.<a id="FNanchor_2071_2071" href="#Footnote_2071_2071" class="fnanchor">2071</a> In
the Island of Ponapé, according to Dr. Finsch, love in our
sense of the term is entirely unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2072_2072" href="#Footnote_2072_2072" class="fnanchor">2072</a> As regards the
Eskimo of Newfoundland, Heriot asserts, “Like all other men
in the savage state, they treat their wives with great coldness
and neglect, but their affection towards their offspring is lively
and tender.”<a id="FNanchor_2073_2073" href="#Footnote_2073_2073" class="fnanchor">2073</a> In Greenland, a man thought nothing of
beating his wife, but it was an heinous offence for a mother to
chastise her children.<a id="FNanchor_2074_2074" href="#Footnote_2074_2074" class="fnanchor">2074</a> Almost the same is said of the
Kutchin by Mr. Jones, and of the Eskimo of Norton Sound
by Mr. Dall.<a id="FNanchor_2075_2075" href="#Footnote_2075_2075" class="fnanchor">2075</a> According to Mr. Morgan, the refined passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
of love is unknown to the North American Indians in
general.<a id="FNanchor_2076_2076" href="#Footnote_2076_2076" class="fnanchor">2076</a></p>

<p>Such statements, however, may easily be misleading. The
love of a savage is certainly very different from the love of a
civilized man; nevertheless, we may discover in it traces of
the same ingredients. There are facts which tend to show
that even very rude savages may have conjugal affection;
nay, that among certain uncivilized peoples it has reached a
remarkably high degree of development.</p>

<p>Among the wretched Bushmans, according to Mr. Chapman,
there is love in all their marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2077_2077" href="#Footnote_2077_2077" class="fnanchor">2077</a> Among the races
of the Upper Congo, love is ennobled by a certain poetry;<a id="FNanchor_2078_2078" href="#Footnote_2078_2078" class="fnanchor">2078</a>
and with the Touaregs, there is a touch of almost chivalrous
sentiment in the relations between men and women.<a id="FNanchor_2079_2079" href="#Footnote_2079_2079" class="fnanchor">2079</a> Regarding
the man-eating Niam-Niam, Dr. Schweinfurth asserts that
they display an affection for their wives which is unparalleled
among other natives of an equally low grade.<a id="FNanchor_2080_2080" href="#Footnote_2080_2080" class="fnanchor">2080</a></p>

<p>The Hos are good husbands and wives, and although they
have no terms in their own language to express the higher
emotions, “they feel them all the same.”<a id="FNanchor_2081_2081" href="#Footnote_2081_2081" class="fnanchor">2081</a> The missionary
Jellinghaus found tokens of affectionate love between married
people among the Munda Kols, Mr. Fawcett among the
Savaras, Sir Spenser St. John among the Sea Dyaks, Mr.
Man among the Andamanese.<a id="FNanchor_2082_2082" href="#Footnote_2082_2082" class="fnanchor">2082</a> In New Caledonia, says
M. Moncelon, “l’amour existe, et j’ai vu des suicides par
amour.”<a id="FNanchor_2083_2083" href="#Footnote_2083_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a> In Samoa, stories of affectionate love between
husband and wife are preserved in song.<a id="FNanchor_2084_2084" href="#Footnote_2084_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a> In Tonga, according
to Mariner, most of the women were much attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
to their husbands;<a id="FNanchor_2085_2085" href="#Footnote_2085_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a> and in Fiji, says Dr. Seemann, “even
widowers, in the depth of their grief, have frequently
terminated their existence, when deprived of a dearly beloved
wife.”<a id="FNanchor_2086_2086" href="#Footnote_2086_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a> In several of the Australian tribes, married people
are often much attached to each other, and continue to be so
even when they grow old.<a id="FNanchor_2087_2087" href="#Footnote_2087_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a> Concerning the aborigines of
Victoria, Daniel Bunce says it is an error to suppose that
there exists no settled love or lasting affection between the
sexes; among the Narrinyeri, Mr. Taplin has known as well-matched
and loving couples as he has among Europeans;
and, according to Mr. Bonney, husband and wife among the
natives of the River Darling, rarely quarrel, and “they show
much affection for each other in their own way.”<a id="FNanchor_2088_2088" href="#Footnote_2088_2088" class="fnanchor">2088</a></p>

<p>Among the Eskimo of the north-east coast of North
America, visited by Lyon, “young couples are frequently
seen rubbing noses, their favourite mark of affection, with an
air of tenderness.”<a id="FNanchor_2089_2089" href="#Footnote_2089_2089" class="fnanchor">2089</a> The Tacullies, as Harman informs us,
are remarkably fond of their wives.<a id="FNanchor_2090_2090" href="#Footnote_2090_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a> And Mr. Catlin goes
even so far as to deny that the North American Indians are
“in the least behind us in conjugal, in filial, and in paternal
affection,”<a id="FNanchor_2091_2091" href="#Footnote_2091_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a>—a statement with which Mr. Morgan does not
agree. Mr. Brett asserts that, among the natives of Guiana,
instances of conjugal attachment are very frequent.<a id="FNanchor_2092_2092" href="#Footnote_2092_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a> Azara
and Mantegazza found tokens of it among some other South
American tribes;<a id="FNanchor_2093_2093" href="#Footnote_2093_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a> and the rude Fuegians are said to “show
a good deal of affection for their wives.”<a id="FNanchor_2094_2094" href="#Footnote_2094_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a></p>

<p>It is, indeed, impossible to believe that there ever was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
time when conjugal affection was entirely wanting in the
human race. Though originally of far less intensity than
parental love, especially on the mother’s side, as being of less
importance for the existence of the species, yet it seems, in
its most primitive form, to have been as old as marriage itself.
It must be a certain degree of affection that induces the male
to defend the female during her period of pregnancy; but
often it is the joint care of the offspring, more than anything
else, that makes the married couple attached to each other.
With reference to the Dacotahs, Mr. Prescott remarks that
“as children increase, the parents appear to be more affectionate.”<a id="FNanchor_2095_2095" href="#Footnote_2095_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a></p>

<p>Of course it is impossible to suppose that mutual love can
generally be the motive which leads to marriage when the
wife is captured or purchased from a foreign tribe. In the
main, Mr. Hall’s assertion as to the Eskimo visited by him,
that “love—if it come at all—comes after the marriage,”<a id="FNanchor_2096_2096" href="#Footnote_2096_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a>
holds good for many savage peoples. Among the Australians,
for instance, according to Mr. Brough Smyth, love has
often no part in the preparations for marriage. “The bride
is dragged from her home—she is unwilling to leave it; and
if fears are entertained that she will endeavour to escape, a
spear is thrust through her foot or her leg. A kind husband
will, however, ultimately evoke affection, and fidelity and true
love are not rare in Australian families.”<a id="FNanchor_2097_2097" href="#Footnote_2097_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a></p>

<p>The affection accompanying the union of the sexes has
gradually developed in proportion as altruism in general has
increased. Thus love has only slowly become the refined feeling
it is in the heart of a highly civilized European. In Eastern
countries with their ancient civilization there exists even now
but little of that tenderness towards the woman which is the
principal charm of our own family life. In China, up to
recent times, it was considered “good form” for a man to beat
his wife, and, if the Chinaman of humble rank spared her a
little, he did so only in order not to come under the necessity
of buying a successor.<a id="FNanchor_2098_2098" href="#Footnote_2098_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a> In Hindu families, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
Dubois, sincere mutual friendship is rarely met with. “It is
in vain,” he says, “to expect, between husband and wife, that
reciprocal confidence and kindness which constitute the happiness
of a family. The object for which a Hindu marries is
not to gain a companion to aid him in enduring the evils of
life, but a slave to bear children and be subservient to his rule.”<a id="FNanchor_2099_2099" href="#Footnote_2099_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a>
The love of which the Persian poets sing has either a symbolic
or a very profane meaning.<a id="FNanchor_2100_2100" href="#Footnote_2100_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a> Among the Arabs, says
Burckhardt, “the passion of love is, indeed, much talked of by
the inhabitants of towns; but I doubt whether anything is
meant by them more than the grossest animal desire.”<a id="FNanchor_2101_2101" href="#Footnote_2101_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a> Mr.
Finck remarks that in the whole of the Bible there is not a
single reference to romantic love.<a id="FNanchor_2102_2102" href="#Footnote_2102_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a> And even in Greece,
according to some authorities, the love of the sexes was little
more than sexual instinct.<a id="FNanchor_2103_2103" href="#Footnote_2103_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a></p>

<p>It is also obvious that marriage cannot be contracted from
affection where the young women before marriage are kept
quite apart from the men, as is done in Eastern countries.
In China it often happens that the parties have not even seen
each other till the wedding-day; and, in Greece, custom was
scarcely less rigorous in this respect.<a id="FNanchor_2104_2104" href="#Footnote_2104_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a> In vain Plato urged
that young men and women should be more frequently permitted
to meet one another, so that there should be less
enmity and indifference in the married life.<a id="FNanchor_2105_2105" href="#Footnote_2105_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a> Plutarch hopes
that love will come after marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2106_2106" href="#Footnote_2106_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a></p>

<p>The feeling which makes husband and wife true companions
for better and worse can grow up only in societies
where the altruistic sentiments of man are strong enough to
make him recognize woman as his equal, and where she is
not shut up as an exotic plant in a green-house, but is allowed
to associate freely with men. In this direction European
civilization has been advancing for centuries, and there can
be no reason to fear that it will ever be permanently diverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
from the path by which alone some of the most important of
its ends can be attained.</p>

<p>When affection came to play a more prominent part in
human sexual selection, higher regard was paid to intellectual,
emotional, and moral qualities, through which the feeling is
chiefly provoked. Later on, we shall see how great are the
consequences which spring from this fact. For the present
it may be enough to say that the preference given to higher
qualities by civilized men contributes much to the mental
improvement of the race. Dr. Stark observes that the intemperate,
profligate, and criminal classes do not commonly
marry; and the like is to a large extent true of persons who
are very inferior in intellect, emotions, and will.<a id="FNanchor_2107_2107" href="#Footnote_2107_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a></p>

<p>Affection depends in a very high degree upon sympathy.
Though distinct aptitudes, these two classes of emotions are
most intimately connected: affection is strengthened by
sympathy, and sympathy is strengthened by affection. Community
of interests, opinions, sentiments, culture, and mode
of life, as being essential to close sympathy,<a id="FNanchor_2108_2108" href="#Footnote_2108_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a> is therefore
favourable to warm affection. If love is excited by contrast,
it is so only within certain limits. The contrast must not be
so great as to exclude sympathy.</p>

<p>Great difference of age is fatal to close sympathy. Wieland
noted that most people who fall in love do so with persons
of about their own age;<a id="FNanchor_2109_2109" href="#Footnote_2109_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a> and statistics prove the observation
to be correct. Men who marry comparatively late in life
usually avoid too great difference in age.<a id="FNanchor_2110_2110" href="#Footnote_2110_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a> The foundation of
this admiration and preference, modified by age, says Mr.
Walker, “appears to be the similarity of objects and interests
which are inseparable from similar periods of life, the association
of these with a similar intensity of sexual desire, the consequent
production of similar sympathy, and the resolve that
it shall be permanent.”<a id="FNanchor_2111_2111" href="#Footnote_2111_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a></p>

<p>A very important factor is similarity in the degree of cultivation.
It seldom happens that a “gentleman” falls in love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
with a peasant-girl, or an artizan with a “lady.” This does
more than almost anything else to maintain the separation of
the different classes, and to preserve the existing distribution
of wealth among the various groups of society.</p>

<p>Want of sympathy prevents great divisions of human beings—such
as different races or nations, hereditary castes, classes,
and adherents of different religions—from intermarrying, even
where personal affection plays no part in the choice of the
mate. Thus many uncivilized peoples carefully avoid marrying
out of their own tribe, the chief reason being, I think, the
strong dislike which distinct savage and barbarous nations
have for one another. Mr. McLennan called such peoples
“endogamous,” in contradistinction to peoples who are
“exogamous,” <i>i.e.</i>, do not marry within their own tribe or clan.
But this classification has caused much confusion, “exogamy”
and “endogamy” not being real contraries. For there exists
among every people an outer circle—to use Sir Henry Maine’s
very appropriate terminology—out of which marriage is either
prohibited, or generally avoided; as well as an inner circle,
including the clan, or, at any rate, the very nearest kinsfolk,
within which no marriage is allowed.</p>

<p>Like the inner circle, the outer circle varies considerably in
extent. Rengger states that many of the Indian races of
Paraguay are too proud to intermarry with any race of a
different colour, or even of a different stock.<a id="FNanchor_2112_2112" href="#Footnote_2112_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a> In Guiana and
elsewhere, Indians do not readily intermix with negroes,
whom they despise.<a id="FNanchor_2113_2113" href="#Footnote_2113_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a> Among the Isthmians of Central America,
“marriage was not contracted with strangers or people
speaking a different language”;<a id="FNanchor_2114_2114" href="#Footnote_2114_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a> and in San Salvador, according
to Palacio, a man who had intercourse with a foreign
woman was killed.<a id="FNanchor_2115_2115" href="#Footnote_2115_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a> Mr. Powers informs us of a Californian
tribe who would put to death a woman for committing
adultery with or marrying a white man;<a id="FNanchor_2116_2116" href="#Footnote_2116_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a> and among the Baro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>longs,
a Bechuana tribe, the same punishment was formerly
inflicted on any one who had intercourse with a European.<a id="FNanchor_2117_2117" href="#Footnote_2117_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a>
Among the Kabyles, “le mariage avec une négresse n’est pas
défendu en principe; mais la famille s’opposerait à une
pareille union.”<a id="FNanchor_2118_2118" href="#Footnote_2118_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a></p>

<p>The Chinese, according to Mr. Jamieson, refuse marriage
with the surrounding barbarous tribes, with whom, as a rule,
they have no dealings, either friendly or hostile.<a id="FNanchor_2119_2119" href="#Footnote_2119_2119" class="fnanchor">2119</a> The black
and fairer people of the Philippines have from time immemorial
dwelt in the same country without producing an intermediate
race;<a id="FNanchor_2120_2120" href="#Footnote_2120_2120" class="fnanchor">2120</a> the Bugis of Perak have kept themselves
very distinct from the people among whom they live;<a id="FNanchor_2121_2121" href="#Footnote_2121_2121" class="fnanchor">2121</a> and,
in Sumatra, it is a rare thing for a Malay man to marry a
Kubu woman.<a id="FNanchor_2122_2122" href="#Footnote_2122_2122" class="fnanchor">2122</a> The Munda Kols severely punish a girl who
is seduced by a Hindu, whereas intercourse with a man of
their own people is regarded by most of them as quite a
matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_2123_2123" href="#Footnote_2123_2123" class="fnanchor">2123</a> And, in Ceylon, even those Veddahs who
live in settlements, although they have long associated with
their neighbours, the Sinhalese, have not yet intermarried with
them.<a id="FNanchor_2124_2124" href="#Footnote_2124_2124" class="fnanchor">2124</a></p>

<p>Count de Gobineau remarks that not even a common
religion and country can extinguish the hereditary aversion
of the Arab to the Turk, of the Kurd to the Nestorian of
Syria, of the Magyar to the Slav.<a id="FNanchor_2125_2125" href="#Footnote_2125_2125" class="fnanchor">2125</a> Indeed, so strong, among
the Arabs, is the instinct of ethnical isolation, that, as a
traveller relates, at Djidda, where sexual morality is held in
little respect, a Bedouin woman may yield herself for money
to a Turk or European, but would think herself for ever dishonoured
if she were joined to him in lawful wedlock.<a id="FNanchor_2126_2126" href="#Footnote_2126_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>Marriages between Lapps and Swedes very rarely occur,
being looked upon as dishonourable by both peoples. They
are equally uncommon between Lapps and Norwegians, and
it hardly ever happens that a Lapp marries a Russian.<a id="FNanchor_2127_2127" href="#Footnote_2127_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a> At
various times, Spaniards in Central America, Englishmen in
Mauritius, Frenchmen in Réunion and the Antilles, and
Danish traders in Greenland, have been prevented by law
from marrying natives.<a id="FNanchor_2128_2128" href="#Footnote_2128_2128" class="fnanchor">2128</a> Among the Hebrews, during the
early days of their power and dominion, marriages with
aliens seem to have been rare exceptions.<a id="FNanchor_2129_2129" href="#Footnote_2129_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a> The Romans
were prohibited from marrying barbarians; Valentinian inflicted
the penalty of death for such unions.<a id="FNanchor_2130_2130" href="#Footnote_2130_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a> Tacitus was
of opinion that the Germans refused marriage with foreign
nations,<a id="FNanchor_2131_2131" href="#Footnote_2131_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a> and the like seems to have been the case with the
Slavs.<a id="FNanchor_2132_2132" href="#Footnote_2132_2132" class="fnanchor">2132</a></p>

<p>Among several peoples marriage very seldom, or never,
takes place even outside the territory of the tribe or community.
This is the case with many tribes of Guatemala,<a id="FNanchor_2133_2133" href="#Footnote_2133_2133" class="fnanchor">2133</a>
the Ahts,<a id="FNanchor_2134_2134" href="#Footnote_2134_2134" class="fnanchor">2134</a> Navajos,<a id="FNanchor_2135_2135" href="#Footnote_2135_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a> and Pueblos.<a id="FNanchor_2136_2136" href="#Footnote_2136_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a> In the village of
Schawill, in Southern Mexico, according to Mr. Stephens,
“every member must marry within the rancho, and no
such thing as a marriage out of it had ever occurred.
They said it was impossible, it could not happen.... This
was a thing so little apprehended that the punishment for it
was not defined in their penal code; but being questioned,
after some consultations, they said that the offender, whether
man or woman, would be expelled.”<a id="FNanchor_2137_2137" href="#Footnote_2137_2137" class="fnanchor">2137</a> Speaking of the
Chaymas in New Andalusia, among whom marriages are
contracted between the inhabitants of the same hamlet only,<a id="FNanchor_2138_2138" href="#Footnote_2138_2138" class="fnanchor">2138</a>
v. Humboldt says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span> “Savage nations are subdivided into an
infinity of tribes, which, bearing a cruel hatred toward each
other, form no intermarriages, even when their languages
spring from the same root, and when only a small arm of a
river, or a group of hills, separates their habitations.”<a id="FNanchor_2139_2139" href="#Footnote_2139_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a> This
holds good especially for several of the Brazilian tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2140_2140" href="#Footnote_2140_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a> In
ancient Peru it was not lawful for the natives of one province
or village to marry those of another.<a id="FNanchor_2141_2141" href="#Footnote_2141_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a></p>

<p>In Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Du Chaillu, the non-cannibal
tribes do not intermarry with their cannibal neighbours,

Barrow states that the Hottentots always marry within their
own kraal;<a id="FNanchor_2143_2143" href="#Footnote_2143_2143" class="fnanchor">2143</a> and a Bushman woman would regard intercourse
with any one out of the tribe, no matter how superior, as a
degradation.<a id="FNanchor_2144_2144" href="#Footnote_2144_2144" class="fnanchor">2144</a> Among the Hovas, the different tribes, clans,
and even families as a rule do not intermarry, as Mr. Sibree
says, “in order to keep landed property together, as well as
from a strong clannish feeling.”<a id="FNanchor_2145_2145" href="#Footnote_2145_2145" class="fnanchor">2145</a> Mr. Swann informs me that,
among the Waguha, of West Tanganyika, marriages out of

<p>In India there are several instances of tribe-or clan-endogamy.<a id="FNanchor_2146_2146" href="#Footnote_2146_2146" class="fnanchor">2146</a>
The Tipperahs and Abors, for example, view
with abhorrence the idea of their girls marrying out of their
own clan,<a id="FNanchor_2147_2147" href="#Footnote_2147_2147" class="fnanchor">2147</a> and Colonel Dalton was gravely assured that,
“when one of the daughters of Pádam so demeans herself, the
sun and the moon refuse to shine, and there is such a strife in
the elements that all labour is necessarily suspended, till by
sacrifice and oblation the stain is washed away.”<a id="FNanchor_2148_2148" href="#Footnote_2148_2148" class="fnanchor">2148</a> The Ainos

and New Britain,<a id="FNanchor_2154_2154" href="#Footnote_2154_2154" class="fnanchor">2154</a> as a general rule, marry within their own
tribe. Among the New Zealanders, according to Mr. Yate,
“great opposition is made to any one taking, except for
some political purpose, a wife from another tribe,” and marriage
generally takes place between relatives.<a id="FNanchor_2155_2155" href="#Footnote_2155_2155" class="fnanchor">2155</a> In Australia
there are groups of tribes, so-called associated tribes, generally
speaking the same dialect, who are in the habit of
uniting for common defence and other purposes. Marriage
between the members of associated tribes is the rule,<a id="FNanchor_2156_2156" href="#Footnote_2156_2156" class="fnanchor">2156</a>
but many tribes are mostly endogamous.<a id="FNanchor_2157_2157" href="#Footnote_2157_2157" class="fnanchor">2157</a></p>

<p>In ancient Wales, according to Mr. Lewis, marriage was
to be within the clan.<a id="FNanchor_2158_2158" href="#Footnote_2158_2158" class="fnanchor">2158</a> At Athens, at least in its later
history, if an alien lived as a husband with an Athenian
woman, he was liable to be sold as a slave, and to have his
property confiscated; and, if an Athenian lived with a foreign
woman, she was liable to like consequences, and he to a
penalty of a thousand drachmæ.<a id="FNanchor_2159_2159" href="#Footnote_2159_2159" class="fnanchor">2159</a> Marriage with foreign

marriage of a citizen with a woman who was not herself a
Roman citizen, or did not belong to a community possessing
the privilege of <i>connubium</i> with Rome—which was always

could be born of such a marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2161_2161" href="#Footnote_2161_2161" class="fnanchor">2161</a> In early times it was
even customary for a father to seek, for his daughter, a husband

as an extraordinary thing.<a id="FNanchor_2162_2162" href="#Footnote_2162_2162" class="fnanchor">2162</a></p>

<p>Prohibitions of intermarriage do not refer only to persons
belonging to different nations or tribes; very often they relate
also to persons belonging to different classes or castes of the
same community. Yet in many, perhaps most, cases these
prohibitions originally coincided. Castes are frequently, if not
always, the consequences of foreign conquest and subjugation,
the conquerors becoming the nobility, and the subjugated the
commonalty or slaves. Thus, before the Norman conquest,
the English aristocracy was Saxon; after it, Norman. The
descendants of the German conquerors of Gaul were, for a
thousand years, the dominant race in France; and until the
fifteenth century all the higher nobility were of Frankish or
Burgundian origin.<a id="FNanchor_2163_2163" href="#Footnote_2163_2163" class="fnanchor">2163</a> The Sanskrit word for caste is “varna,”
<i>i.e.</i>, colour, which shows how the distinction of high and low
caste arose in India. That country was inhabited by dark
races before the fairer Aryans took possession of it; and the
bitter contempt of the Aryans for foreign tribes, their domineering
spirit, and their strong antipathies of race and of religion,
found vent in the pride of class and caste distinctions. Even
to this day a careful observer can distinguish the descendants
of conquerors and conquered. “No sojourner in India,” says
Dr. Stevenson, “can have paid any attention to the physiognomy
of the higher and lower orders of natives without
being struck with the remarkable difference that exists in the
shape of the head, the build of the body, and the colour of the
skin between the higher and the lower castes into which the
Hindu population is divided.”<a id="FNanchor_2164_2164" href="#Footnote_2164_2164" class="fnanchor">2164</a> This explanation of the origin
of Indian castes is supported by the fact that it is in some of
the latest Vedic hymns that we find the earliest references to
those four classes—the Brahmans, the Kshatriyas, the Vaiśyas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
and the Śudras—to which all the later castes have been traced
back.<a id="FNanchor_2165_2165" href="#Footnote_2165_2165" class="fnanchor">2165</a> The Incas of Peru were known as a conquering race;
and the ancient Mexicans represented the culture-heroes of
the Toltecs as white.<a id="FNanchor_2166_2166" href="#Footnote_2166_2166" class="fnanchor">2166</a> Among the Beni-Amer, the nobles
are mostly light coloured, while the commoners are blackish.<a id="FNanchor_2167_2167" href="#Footnote_2167_2167" class="fnanchor">2167</a>
The Polynesian nobility have a comparatively fair complexion,<a id="FNanchor_2168_2168" href="#Footnote_2168_2168" class="fnanchor">2168</a>
and seem to be the descendants of a conquering or
superior race. “The chiefs, and persons of hereditary rank
and influence in the islands,” says Ellis, “are, almost without
exception, as much superior to the peasantry or common
people, in stateliness, dignified deportment, and physical
strength, as they are in rank and circumstances; although
they are not elected to their station on account of their
personal endowments, but derive their rank and elevation from
their ancestry. This is the case with most of the groups of the
Pacific, but particularly so in Tahiti and the adjacent islands.”<a id="FNanchor_2169_2169" href="#Footnote_2169_2169" class="fnanchor">2169</a>
Among the Shans, according to Dr. Anderson, “the majority
of the higher classes seemed to be distinguished from the
common people by more elongated oval faces and a decidedly
Tartar type of countenance.”<a id="FNanchor_2170_2170" href="#Footnote_2170_2170" class="fnanchor">2170</a> In America, at the time of the
earliest European immigration, a kind of caste distinction
arose, white blood being synonymous with nobility; and, in
La Plata, Spaniards, Mestizoes, and Indians were separated
from each other even in church.<a id="FNanchor_2171_2171" href="#Footnote_2171_2171" class="fnanchor">2171</a></p>

<p>As descendants of different ancestors, members of noble
families keep up their separate position, and remain almost as
foreigners to the people among whom they live. Speculating
on the want of sympathy among the various classes in
societies in which such distinctions are recognized, Count de
Tocqueville says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span> “Each caste has its own opinions, feelings,
rights, manners, and modes of living. Thus the men of whom
each caste is composed do not resemble the mass of their
fellow-citizens; they do not think or feel in the same
manner, and they scarcely believe that they belong to the
same human race.... When the chroniclers of the Middle
Ages, who all belonged to the aristocracy by birth or education,
relate the tragical end of a noble, their grief flows apace;
whereas they tell you at a breath, and without wincing, of
massacres and tortures inflicted on the common sort of people.
Not that these writers felt habitual hatred or systematic disdain
for the people; war between the several classes of the
community was not yet declared. They were impelled by an
instinct rather than by a passion; as they had formed no clear
notion of a poor man’s sufferings, they cared but little for his
fate.” Then, in proof of this, the writer gives extracts from
Madame de Sévigné’s letters, displaying a cruel jocularity
which, in our day, “the harshest man writing to the most insensible
person of his acquaintance” would not venture wantonly
to indulge in; and yet Madame de Sévigné was not selfish or
cruel: she was passionately attached to her children, and ever
ready to sympathize with her friends, and she treated her
servants and vassals with kindness and indulgence.<a id="FNanchor_2172_2172" href="#Footnote_2172_2172" class="fnanchor">2172</a></p>

<p>It is to this want of affection and sympathy between the
different layers of society, together with the vain desire of
keeping the blood pure, that the prohibition of marriage out
of the class, or the general avoidance of such marriages, owes
its origin. Among the Ahts, for instance, who take great
pride in honourable birth, a patrician loses caste unless he
marries a woman of corresponding rank, in his own or another
tribe.<a id="FNanchor_2173_2173" href="#Footnote_2173_2173" class="fnanchor">2173</a> Among the Isthmians of Central America, the lords
married only the daughters of noble blood; and, in Guatemala,
marriage with a slave reduced the freeman to a slave’s
condition.<a id="FNanchor_2174_2174" href="#Footnote_2174_2174" class="fnanchor">2174</a> The tribes of Brazil also consider such alliances
highly disgraceful.<a id="FNanchor_2175_2175" href="#Footnote_2175_2175" class="fnanchor">2175</a></p>

<p>Nowhere are the different orders of society more distinctly
separated from each other than in the South Sea Islands. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the Marianne group, it was the common belief that only the
nobles were endowed with an immortal soul; and a nobleman
who married a girl of the people was punished with death.<a id="FNanchor_2176_2176" href="#Footnote_2176_2176" class="fnanchor">2176</a>
In Polynesia also, the commoners were looked upon by the
nobility almost as a different species of beings.<a id="FNanchor_2177_2177" href="#Footnote_2177_2177" class="fnanchor">2177</a> Hence in
the higher ranks marriage was concluded only between
persons of corresponding position; and if, in Tahiti, a woman
of condition chose an inferior person as a husband, the
children he had by her were killed.<a id="FNanchor_2178_2178" href="#Footnote_2178_2178" class="fnanchor">2178</a> In the Indian Archipelago,
marriages between persons of different rank are, as a
rule, disapproved, and in some places they are prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_2179_2179" href="#Footnote_2179_2179" class="fnanchor">2179</a>
Among the Hovas of Madagascar, the three great divisions—the
nobles, the commoners, and the slaves,—with few exceptions,
cannot intermarry; neither do the three different
classes of slaves marry each other.<a id="FNanchor_2180_2180" href="#Footnote_2180_2180" class="fnanchor">2180</a> Almost the same rule
holds good for the different orders of the Beni-Amer and
Marea;<a id="FNanchor_2181_2181" href="#Footnote_2181_2181" class="fnanchor">2181</a> whilst, among the Tedâ, the smiths form an
hereditary and utterly despised caste by themselves, being
obliged to marry solely with members of their own caste.<a id="FNanchor_2182_2182" href="#Footnote_2182_2182" class="fnanchor">2182</a>
By several African peoples, however, slaves and freemen are
allowed to intermarry.<a id="FNanchor_2183_2183" href="#Footnote_2183_2183" class="fnanchor">2183</a></p>

<p>The Aenezes of Arabia never intermarry with the “szona,”

daughters to Fellahs, or to inhabitants of towns.<a id="FNanchor_2184_2184" href="#Footnote_2184_2184" class="fnanchor">2184</a> In India,
intermarriage between different castes was in Manu’s time
permissible, but is now altogether prohibited. Of the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
four castes, the Brahmans alone have retained their purity to
any extent, but there is an almost endless number of trade-castes,
resulting chiefly from associations of men engaged in
the same occupation.<a id="FNanchor_2185_2185" href="#Footnote_2185_2185" class="fnanchor">2185</a> Moreover, as Sir Monier Williams
remarks, “we find castes within castes, so that even the
Brahmans are broken up and divided into numerous races,
which again are subdivided into numerous tribes, families, or
sub-castes ... which do not intermarry.”<a id="FNanchor_2186_2186" href="#Footnote_2186_2186" class="fnanchor">2186</a> Class-endogamy
prevails in Ceylon,<a id="FNanchor_2187_2187" href="#Footnote_2187_2187" class="fnanchor">2187</a> Siam,<a id="FNanchor_2188_2188" href="#Footnote_2188_2188" class="fnanchor">2188</a> and Corea;<a id="FNanchor_2189_2189" href="#Footnote_2189_2189" class="fnanchor">2189</a> and in the Chittagong
district, when a slave marries, the person chosen must be a
slave.<a id="FNanchor_2190_2190" href="#Footnote_2190_2190" class="fnanchor">2190</a> In China, play-actors, policemen, boatmen, and slaves
are not allowed to marry women of any other class than that
to which they respectively belong.<a id="FNanchor_2191_2191" href="#Footnote_2191_2191" class="fnanchor">2191</a> And in Japan, before the
year 1868, when a new order of things was introduced, the
different classes of nobles were not permitted to intermarry
with each other or with common people.<a id="FNanchor_2192_2192" href="#Footnote_2192_2192" class="fnanchor">2192</a></p>

<p>In Europe there have been similar prohibitions. In Rome,
plebeians and patricians could not intermarry till the year
455 B.C., nor were marriages allowed between patricians and
clients. Cicero himself disapproved of intermarriages of <i>ingenui</i>
and freedmen, and, though such alliances were generally
permitted under the Emperors, yet a senator could not marry
a freed-woman, nor a patroness her liberated slave. Between
freemen and slaves <i>contubernium</i> could take place, but not
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2193_2193" href="#Footnote_2193_2193" class="fnanchor">2193</a> Among the Teutonic peoples, in ancient times,
any freeman who had intercourse with a slave was punished
with slavery, and a woman guilty of such a crime might be
killed. In the Scandinavian countries, slavery came to an
end at a comparatively early period, but in Germany it was
succeeded by serfdom; and equality of birth continued to be
regarded as an indispensable condition of lawful marriage.
As late as the thirteenth century any German woman who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
had intercourse with a serf lost her liberty.<a id="FNanchor_2194_2194" href="#Footnote_2194_2194" class="fnanchor">2194</a> From the class
of freemen, both in Germany and in Scandinavia, the nobility
gradually emerged as a distinct order, and marriages between
persons of noble birth and persons who, although free, were
not noble, came to be considered misalliances.<a id="FNanchor_2195_2195" href="#Footnote_2195_2195" class="fnanchor">2195</a> In Sweden,
in the seventeenth century, such marriages were punished.<a id="FNanchor_2196_2196" href="#Footnote_2196_2196" class="fnanchor">2196</a></p>

<p>Modern civilization tends to pull down the barriers which
separate the various classes of society, just as it tends to
diminish the differences in interests, habits, sentiments, and
knowledge. Birth no longer determines to the same extent
as before a man’s social position, and nobility has become a
shadow of what it was. Thus there survive but few traces of
the former class-endogamy. According to German Civil
Law, the marriage of a man belonging to the high nobility
with a woman of inferior birth is still regarded as a <i>disparagium</i>;
and the woman is not entitled to the rank of her
husband, nor is the full right of inheritance possessed by her
or by her children.<a id="FNanchor_2197_2197" href="#Footnote_2197_2197" class="fnanchor">2197</a> Although in no way prevented by law,
marriages out of the class are generally avoided by custom.
“The outer or endogamous limit, within which a man or
woman must marry,” says Sir Henry Maine, “has been mostly
taken under the shelter of fashion or prejudice. It is but
faintly traced in England, though not wholly obscured. It is
(or perhaps was) rather more distinctly marked in the United
States, through prejudices against the blending of white and
coloured blood. But in Germany certain hereditary dignities
are still forfeited by a marriage beyond the forbidden limits;
and in France, in spite of all formal institutions, marriages
between a person belonging to the <i>noblesse</i> and a person
belonging to the <i>bourgeoisie</i> (distinguished roughly from one
another by the particle ‘de’) are wonderfully rare, though
they are not unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2198_2198" href="#Footnote_2198_2198" class="fnanchor">2198</a></p>

<p>Different nations, like the different classes of society, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
been gradually drawing nearer to each other. National
prejudices have diminished, and international sympathy has
increased. During the Middle Ages a foreigner was called in
Germany “ein Elender,” because he stood outside the law;<a id="FNanchor_2199_2199" href="#Footnote_2199_2199" class="fnanchor">2199</a>
to-day he enjoys the protection of the law in all civilized
countries, and is not as a foreigner an object of prejudice.
This widening of sympathy, and improved means of communication,
have of course made intermarriages between the
several nations much more common than they used to be.</p>

<p>Religion, finally, has formed a great bar to intermarriage.
In British India, the descendants of all the Mohammedan
races—Arab, Iranian, Turanian, Mongol, and Hindu converts—intermarry,
but there are few unions between Christian men
and Mohammedan women.<a id="FNanchor_2200_2200" href="#Footnote_2200_2200" class="fnanchor">2200</a> Indeed, according to Mr. Lane,
such a marriage is not permitted under any circumstances,
and cannot take place otherwise than by force. On the
other hand, it is held lawful for a Mohammedan to marry a
Christian or a Jewish woman, if induced to do so by excessive
love of her, or if he cannot obtain a wife of his own religion.
In this case, however, the offspring must follow the father’s
faith, and the wife does not inherit when the husband dies.<a id="FNanchor_2201_2201" href="#Footnote_2201_2201" class="fnanchor">2201</a>
Marriage with a heathen woman is never permitted to a
Mussulman.<a id="FNanchor_2202_2202" href="#Footnote_2202_2202" class="fnanchor">2202</a></p>

<p>It is mainly religion that has kept the Jews a relatively
pure race. “The Jew,” says Dr. Neubauer, “has no preference
for, or any aversion from, one race or another, provided he can
marry a woman of his religion, and <i>vice versa</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_2203_2203" href="#Footnote_2203_2203" class="fnanchor">2203</a> Indeed, the
Jewish law does not recognize marriage with a person of
another belief,<a id="FNanchor_2204_2204" href="#Footnote_2204_2204" class="fnanchor">2204</a> though there are instances of such marriages
in the early days of Israel.<a id="FNanchor_2205_2205" href="#Footnote_2205_2205" class="fnanchor">2205</a> During the Middle Ages,
marriage between Jews and Christians was prohibited by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Christians also, and universally avoided.<a id="FNanchor_2206_2206" href="#Footnote_2206_2206" class="fnanchor">2206</a> “The folk-lore of
Europe,” Mr. Jacobs remarks, “regarded the Jews as something
infra-human, and it would require an almost impossible
amount of large toleration for a Christian maiden of the
Middle Ages to regard union with a Jew as anything other
than unnatural.” Mr. Jacobs thinks it may be doubted
whether even at the present day there is one mixed marriage
to five hundred pure Jewish marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2207_2207" href="#Footnote_2207_2207" class="fnanchor">2207</a></p>

<p>St. Paul indicates that a Christian was not allowed to marry
a heathen,<a id="FNanchor_2208_2208" href="#Footnote_2208_2208" class="fnanchor">2208</a> and Tertullian calls such an alliance fornication.<a id="FNanchor_2209_2209" href="#Footnote_2209_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a>
In early times, the Church often encouraged marriages of
this sort as a means of propagating Christianity, and it was
only when its success was beyond doubt that it actually prohibited
them.<a id="FNanchor_2210_2210" href="#Footnote_2210_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a> The Council of Elvira expressly forbade Christian
parents to give their daughters in marriage to heathens,
ordering that those who did so should be excommunicated.<a id="FNanchor_2211_2211" href="#Footnote_2211_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a></p>

<p>Even the adherents of different Christian confessions have
been prohibited from intermarrying. In the Roman Church
the prohibition of marriage with heathens and Jews
(<i>impedimentum cultus disparitatis</i>) was soon followed by
the prohibition of “mixed marriages” (<i>impedimentum mixtae
religionis</i>); and the Protestants also originally forbade
such unions. The Greek Church, on the other hand, made
in this respect a distinction between <i>schismatici</i>, or those
who dissent from the Church in non-essential points only, and
<i>haeretici</i>, or those who dissent from its fundamental doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_2212_2212" href="#Footnote_2212_2212" class="fnanchor">2212</a>
Mixed marriages are not now contrary to the civil law either
in Roman Catholic or in Protestant countries; but in countries
belonging to the Orthodox Greek Church the ecclesiastical
restrictions have been adopted by the State. In Russia,
Greece, and Servia, Roman Catholics and Protestants are regarded
as <i>schismatici</i> but in the Turkish countries as <i>haeretici</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2213_2213" href="#Footnote_2213_2213" class="fnanchor">2213</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
It is noteworthy that, in countries which are partly Roman
Catholic, partly Protestant, mixed marriages form only a
comparatively small percentage of the whole number of
marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2214_2214" href="#Footnote_2214_2214" class="fnanchor">2214</a></p>

<p>In no respect has modern civilization acted more beneficently
than as a promoter of religious toleration. In our time
difference of faith discourages sympathy to a much less extent
than it did in former ages. Hence the number of mixed
marriages everywhere tends to increase. In Bavaria, for
instance, they amounted in 1835-1850 to 2·8 per cent. of the
whole number of marriages, in 1850-1860 to 3·6 per cent., in
1860-1870 to 4·4 per cent., in 1870-1875 to 5·6 per cent.,
and in 1876-1877 to 6·6 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_2215_2215" href="#Footnote_2215_2215" class="fnanchor">2215</a></p>

<p>While, therefore, civilization has narrowed the inner limit,
within which a man or woman must not marry, it has
widened the outer limit within which a man or woman <i>may</i>
marry, and generally marries. The latter of these processes
has been one of vast importance in man’s history. Originating
in race-or caste-pride, or in religious intolerance, the endogamous
rules have, in their turn, helped to keep up and
strengthen these feelings. Law is by nature conservative,
maintaining sentiments developed under past conditions. It
is only by slow degrees that the ideas of a new time become
strong enough to release mankind from ancient prejudices.</p>

<p>We have hitherto dealt only with the poetry of sexual
selection—love; now something is to be said of its prose—dry
calculation. And we may conveniently begin with man’s
appreciation of woman’s fertility, as this has some of the
characteristics of an instinct. Desire for offspring is universal
in mankind. Abortion, indeed, is practised now and then,
and infanticide frequently takes place among many savage
peoples; but these facts do not disprove the general rule.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Crees, Chippewyans, and other Indians on
the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, Harmon says that
“all Indians are very desirous of having a numerous offspring.”<a id="FNanchor_2216_2216" href="#Footnote_2216_2216" class="fnanchor">2216</a>
Among the Ingaliks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> “children are anxiously
desired, even when women have no husbands.”<a id="FNanchor_2217_2217" href="#Footnote_2217_2217" class="fnanchor">2217</a> Among the
Mayas, disappointed couples prayed earnestly, and brought
many offerings to propitiate the god whose anger was supposed
to have deferred their hopes.<a id="FNanchor_2218_2218" href="#Footnote_2218_2218" class="fnanchor">2218</a> “Be numerous in offspring
and descendants,” is a frequent marriage benediction or salutation
in Madagascar; for to die without posterity is looked upon
as a great calamity, and is termed “dead as regards the eye.”<a id="FNanchor_2219_2219" href="#Footnote_2219_2219" class="fnanchor">2219</a>
A negro considers childlessness the greatest disaster which can
happen to him;<a id="FNanchor_2220_2220" href="#Footnote_2220_2220" class="fnanchor">2220</a> Bosman once asked one of the king’s
captains in Fida how many children he had, and he answered,
sighing, that he was so unhappy as not to have many—he
could not pretend to have had above seventy, including those
who were dead. Among the Waganda and Wanyoro, great
rejoicings take place in the case of the birth of twins.<a id="FNanchor_2221_2221" href="#Footnote_2221_2221" class="fnanchor">2221</a> The
Shaman heathens of Siberia regarded an abundance of
children and cattle as the most essential condition of a
man’s happiness.<a id="FNanchor_2222_2222" href="#Footnote_2222_2222" class="fnanchor">2222</a> “Honest people have many children,” a
Japanese proverb says;<a id="FNanchor_2223_2223" href="#Footnote_2223_2223" class="fnanchor">2223</a> the Chinese regard a large family
of sons as a mark of the divine favour;<a id="FNanchor_2224_2224" href="#Footnote_2224_2224" class="fnanchor">2224</a> and to become the
father of a son is described in Indian poems as the greatest
happiness which may fall to the share of a mortal.<a id="FNanchor_2225_2225" href="#Footnote_2225_2225" class="fnanchor">2225</a> In
Persia, childlessness is considered the most horrible calamity.<a id="FNanchor_2226_2226" href="#Footnote_2226_2226" class="fnanchor">2226</a>
One of the chief blessings that Moses in the name of God
promised the Israelites was a numerous progeny; and the
ancient Romans regarded the procreation of legitimate
children as the real end of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2227_2227" href="#Footnote_2227_2227" class="fnanchor">2227</a> “He who has no
children, has no happiness either,” the South Slavonians say;<a id="FNanchor_2228_2228" href="#Footnote_2228_2228" class="fnanchor">2228</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
and German folk-lore compares a marriage without offspring
with a world without sun.<a id="FNanchor_2229_2229" href="#Footnote_2229_2229" class="fnanchor">2229</a></p>

<p>A woman therefore is valued not only as a wife but as a
mother. Nowhere has greater stress been laid on this idea than
in ancient Lacedaemon. A husband, if he considered that the
unfruitfulness of the marriage was owing to himself, gave his
matrimonial rights to a younger man, whose child then belonged
to the husband’s family; and to the wives of men who,
for example, fell in battle before having children, other men,
probably slaves, were assigned, that there might be heirs and
successors to the deceased husband.<a id="FNanchor_2230_2230" href="#Footnote_2230_2230" class="fnanchor">2230</a> Among many peoples
the respect in which a woman is held is proportionate to her
fecundity,<a id="FNanchor_2231_2231" href="#Footnote_2231_2231" class="fnanchor">2231</a> and a barren wife is frequently despised as an
unnatural and useless being.<a id="FNanchor_2232_2232" href="#Footnote_2232_2232" class="fnanchor">2232</a> In Angola, according to
Livingstone, in the native dances, “when any one may wish to
deride another, in the accompanying song a line is introduced,
'So and so has no children, and never will get any.’” The
offended woman feels the insult so keenly that it is not
uncommon for her to rush away and commit suicide.<a id="FNanchor_2233_2233" href="#Footnote_2233_2233" class="fnanchor">2233</a>
Among the Creeks, a man always calls his wife his son’s
mother;<a id="FNanchor_2234_2234" href="#Footnote_2234_2234" class="fnanchor">2234</a> and, among the Todas, in addressing a man with
the casual question, “Are you married?” the ordinary way of
putting it would be to say, “Is there a son?”<a id="FNanchor_2235_2235" href="#Footnote_2235_2235" class="fnanchor">2235</a></p>

<p>It is obvious, then, that fecundity must be one of the
qualities which a man most eagerly requires from his bride.
Mr. Reade tells us that, in certain parts of Africa, especi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>ally
in malarious localities, where women are so frequently
sterile, no one cares to marry a girl till she has borne a child;
and among the Votyaks, according to Dr. Buch, a girl gets
married sooner if she is a mother.<a id="FNanchor_2236_2236" href="#Footnote_2236_2236" class="fnanchor">2236</a></p>

<p>We have seen several instances of husband and wife not
living together as married people before the birth of a child.
Among the Creeks, marriages were contracted for a year, but
if they proved fruitful, they were, as a rule, renewed.<a id="FNanchor_2237_2237" href="#Footnote_2237_2237" class="fnanchor">2237</a> Again,
with regard to an order of the Essenes, Josephus states that,
considering succession to be the principal part of human life,
they tried their spouses for three years, and then married
them only if there was a prospect of the union being fruitful.<a id="FNanchor_2238_2238" href="#Footnote_2238_2238" class="fnanchor">2238</a>
Among many peoples it is the practice for a man to repudiate
a barren wife.</p>

<p>The desire for offspring, with its consequence, the appreciation
of female fecundity, is due to various causes. First, there
is in man an instinct for reproduction. Mr. Marshall remarks,
“Of this desire for progeny I have seen many examples
amongst the Todas, so strongly marked, but to all appearances
apart from the sense of personal ambition, and separate from
any demands of religion or requirements for support in old
age, as to give the impression that it was the primitive faculty
of Philoprogenitiveness, acting so insensibly, naturally, as to
have the character more of a plain instinct, than of an
intelligent human feeling.”<a id="FNanchor_2239_2239" href="#Footnote_2239_2239" class="fnanchor">2239</a> With this instinct a feeling of
parental pride is associated. “Children,” says Hobbes, “are a
man’s power and his honour.”<a id="FNanchor_2240_2240" href="#Footnote_2240_2240" class="fnanchor">2240</a></p>

<p>Among the Hebrews and the ancient Aryan nations, the
desire for offspring, particularly sons, had its root chiefly in religious
belief, being a natural outcome of the idea that the spirits
of the dead were made happy by homage received at the hands
of their male posterity. The same is the case with the Chinese<a id="FNanchor_2241_2241" href="#Footnote_2241_2241" class="fnanchor">2241</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
and Japanese,<a id="FNanchor_2242_2242" href="#Footnote_2242_2242" class="fnanchor">2242</a> and perhaps, to a certain extent, with some
peoples at a lower stage of civilization. The savage believes
that the life which goes on after death, differs in nothing from
this life, that wants and pursuits remain as before, that consequently
the dead man’s spirit eats and drinks, and needs
fire for warmth and cooking. It is, of course, his surviving
descendants who have to see that he is well provided for in
these respects. Hence the offerings to deceased ancestors for
various periods after death and the feasts for the dead.<a id="FNanchor_2243_2243" href="#Footnote_2243_2243" class="fnanchor">2243</a> Among
the Thlinkets according to Holmberg, it sometimes happens
that a man spends his whole fortune as well as his wife’s
marriage portion on such a feast, and has to live as a poor man
for the rest of his life.<a id="FNanchor_2244_2244" href="#Footnote_2244_2244" class="fnanchor">2244</a></p>

<p>But no doubt children are most eagerly longed for by
savage men because they are of use to him in his lifetime.
They are easily supported when young, and in times of want
they may be left to die or be sold. When a few years old, the
sons become able to hunt, fish, and paddle, and later on they
are their father’s companions in war. The daughters help
their mother to provide food, and, when grown up, they are
lucrative objects of trade. Finally, when old, the parents
would often suffer want had they not their children to support
them.<a id="FNanchor_2245_2245" href="#Footnote_2245_2245" class="fnanchor">2245</a> Hence, in a savage condition of life, children are the
chief wealth of the family. And the same is the case at somewhat
higher stages of social development. Mr. Lane remarks
that, in Egypt, “at the age of five or six years, the children
become of use to tend the flocks and herds; and at a more
advanced age, until they marry, they assist their fathers in the
operations of agriculture. The poor in Egypt have often to
depend entirely upon their sons for support in their old age;
but many parents are deprived of these aids, and consequently
reduced to beggary, or almost to starvation.”<a id="FNanchor_2246_2246" href="#Footnote_2246_2246" class="fnanchor">2246</a> To a certain
extent, this holds good for the uneducated classes in Europe
also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p>With the progress of civilization the desire for offspring has
become less intense. The religious motive has of course died
out in the Christian world, and, in proportion as social life
becomes more complicated, and a professional education becomes
more necessary for success in the struggle for existence,
children, at least in “the upper classes” and among
towns-people, put their parents to expense instead of being a
source of wealth. A childless couple may indeed, deplore
the absence of children; but a woman is no longer held in
respect only, or principally, as a mother; and marriage,
according to modern ideas, is something more than an institution
for the procreation of legitimate offspring. Yet it is
remarkable that, in Switzerland, although barrenness is no
sufficient reason for a man to repudiate his wife, two-fifths
of the total number of divorces take place between married
people who have no children whilst the sterile marriages
amount only to one-fifth of the number of marriages.<a id="FNanchor_2247_2247" href="#Footnote_2247_2247" class="fnanchor">2247</a></p>

<p>A wife is of use to her husband not merely because she
gives him labourers, but also because she herself is a labourer.
Drying and preparing fish and meat, lighting and attending
to the fire, transporting baggage, picking berries, dressing
hides and making clothes, cooking food and taking care of
the children—these are, in the savage state, the chief pursuits
of a wife. Among agricultural and cattle-farming peoples,
she has besides, to cultivate the soil and to tend the cattle.
A wife, therefore, is chosen partly because of her ability to
perform such duties. Thus, among the Greenlanders, cleverness
in sewing and skill in the management of household
affairs are the most attractive qualities of a woman.<a id="FNanchor_2248_2248" href="#Footnote_2248_2248" class="fnanchor">2248</a> Among
other Eskimo tribes and in Tierra del Fuego, middle-aged
men will connect themselves with old women who are best
able to take care of their common comforts.<a id="FNanchor_2249_2249" href="#Footnote_2249_2249" class="fnanchor">2249</a> The Inland
Columbians, according to Mr. Bancroft, make “capacity for
work the standard of female excellence;”<a id="FNanchor_2250_2250" href="#Footnote_2250_2250" class="fnanchor">2250</a> and, among the
Turkomans, young widows fetch double the price of spinsters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
because they are more accustomed to hard labour, and more
experienced in household concerns.<a id="FNanchor_2251_2251" href="#Footnote_2251_2251" class="fnanchor">2251</a></p>

<p>A husband’s function is to protect his family from enemies
and to prevent them falling into distress. A woman, as
we have already seen, even instinctively prefers a courageous
and strong man to one who is cowardly and feeble. But
reflection also makes her choose a man who is well able to
defend her and to provide food. Among the Comanches,
says Mr. Parker, “young girls are not averse to marry very
old men, particularly if they are chiefs, as they are always
sure of something to eat.”<a id="FNanchor_2252_2252" href="#Footnote_2252_2252" class="fnanchor">2252</a></p>

<p>At more advanced stages of civilization, money and inherited
property often take the place of skill, strength, and
working ability. Thus, wife-purchase and husband-purchase,
still persist in modern society, though in disguised forms.</p>

<small>MARRIAGE BY CAPTURE AND MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE</small></h2>


<p>The practice of capturing wives prevails in various parts
of the world, and traces of it are met with in the marriage
ceremonies of several peoples, indicating that it occurred much
more frequently in past ages.</p>

<p>Speaking of the inhabitants of Unimak, Coxe says that
they invaded the other Aleutian islands, and carried off
women—the chief object of their incursions.<a id="FNanchor_2253_2253" href="#Footnote_2253_2253" class="fnanchor">2253</a> Among the
Ahts, a man occasionally steals a wife from the women of his
own tribe;<a id="FNanchor_2254_2254" href="#Footnote_2254_2254" class="fnanchor">2254</a> whilst the Bonaks of California usually take
women in battle from other tribes, and the Macas Indians of
Ecuador acquire wives by purchase, if the woman belongs to
the same tribe, but otherwise by force.<a id="FNanchor_2255_2255" href="#Footnote_2255_2255" class="fnanchor">2255</a> All the Carib tribes
used to capture women from different peoples and tribes, so
that the men and women nowhere spoke the same tongue;<a id="FNanchor_2256_2256" href="#Footnote_2256_2256" class="fnanchor">2256</a>
and v. Martius states that, in Brazil, “some tribes habitually
steal their neighbours’ daughters.”<a id="FNanchor_2257_2257" href="#Footnote_2257_2257" class="fnanchor">2257</a></p>

<p>Among the Mosquito Indians, after the wedding is all
arranged and the presents paid, the bridegroom seizes his
bride and carries her off, followed by her female relatives,
who pretend to try to rescue her.<a id="FNanchor_2258_2258" href="#Footnote_2258_2258" class="fnanchor">2258</a> The Araucanians considered
the carrying off of the bride by pretended violence an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
essential prerequisite to the nuptials, and, according to Mr.
E. R. Smith, it is even “a point of honour with the bride
to resist and struggle, however willing she may be.”<a id="FNanchor_2259_2259" href="#Footnote_2259_2259" class="fnanchor">2259</a> The
Uaupés “have no particular ceremony at their marriages, except
that of always carrying away the girl by force, or making
a show of doing so, even when she and her parents are quite
willing.”<a id="FNanchor_2260_2260" href="#Footnote_2260_2260" class="fnanchor">2260</a> Almost the same is said of the Fuegians, though
among them the capture is sometimes more than a ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_2261_2261" href="#Footnote_2261_2261" class="fnanchor">2261</a></p>

<p>Andersson remarks that, among the Bushmans, woman is
only too often <i>belli teterrima causa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2262_2262" href="#Footnote_2262_2262" class="fnanchor">2262</a> Speaking of the Bechuanas,
Mr. Conder says, “As regards wedding ceremonies,
there is one of casting an arrow into the hut by the bridegroom,
which is worthy of notice as symbolic.”<a id="FNanchor_2263_2263" href="#Footnote_2263_2263" class="fnanchor">2263</a> Among the
Wakamba, marriage is an affair of purchase, but the bridegroom
“must then carry off the bride by force or stratagem.”<a id="FNanchor_2264_2264" href="#Footnote_2264_2264" class="fnanchor">2264</a>
The Wa-taïta and Wa-chaga of Eastern Equatorial Africa
have also a marriage ceremony of capture;<a id="FNanchor_2265_2265" href="#Footnote_2265_2265" class="fnanchor">2265</a> and the like is
the case with the Inland Negroes mentioned by Lord Kames,<a id="FNanchor_2266_2266" href="#Footnote_2266_2266" class="fnanchor">2266</a>
and the Abyssinians.<a id="FNanchor_2267_2267" href="#Footnote_2267_2267" class="fnanchor">2267</a> Among the tribes of Eastern Central
Africa described by Mr. Macdonald, marriage by capture
occurs not as a symbol only.<a id="FNanchor_2268_2268" href="#Footnote_2268_2268" class="fnanchor">2268</a></p>

<p>According to a common belief, the Australian method of
obtaining wives is capture in its most brutal form.<a id="FNanchor_2269_2269" href="#Footnote_2269_2269" class="fnanchor">2269</a> But contrary
to Mr. Howitt,<a id="FNanchor_2270_2270" href="#Footnote_2270_2270" class="fnanchor">2270</a> Mr. Curr informs us that only on rare
occasions is a wife captured from another tribe, and carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
off.<a id="FNanchor_2271_2271" href="#Footnote_2271_2271" class="fnanchor">2271</a> The possession of a stolen woman would lead to constant
attacks, hence the tribes set themselves very generally
against the practice.<a id="FNanchor_2272_2272" href="#Footnote_2272_2272" class="fnanchor">2272</a> Even elopements, according to Mr.
Mathew, are now usually more fictitious than real;<a id="FNanchor_2273_2273" href="#Footnote_2273_2273" class="fnanchor">2273</a> but
there are strong reasons for believing that formerly, when the
continent was only partially occupied, elopements from within
the tribe frequently occurred.<a id="FNanchor_2274_2274" href="#Footnote_2274_2274" class="fnanchor">2274</a></p>

<p>In Tasmania the capture of women for wives from hostile
and alien tribes was generally prevalent.<a id="FNanchor_2275_2275" href="#Footnote_2275_2275" class="fnanchor">2275</a> Among the Maoris,
the ancient and most general way of obtaining a wife was for
the man to get together a party of his friends and carry off
the woman by force, apparent or actual.<a id="FNanchor_2276_2276" href="#Footnote_2276_2276" class="fnanchor">2276</a> A similar practice
occurs on the larger islands of the Fiji Group,<a id="FNanchor_2277_2277" href="#Footnote_2277_2277" class="fnanchor">2277</a> in Samoa,<a id="FNanchor_2278_2278" href="#Footnote_2278_2278" class="fnanchor">2278</a>
Tukopia,<a id="FNanchor_2279_2279" href="#Footnote_2279_2279" class="fnanchor">2279</a> New Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_2280_2280" href="#Footnote_2280_2280" class="fnanchor">2280</a> and extremely frequently in the
Indian Archipelago,<a id="FNanchor_2281_2281" href="#Footnote_2281_2281" class="fnanchor">2281</a> and among the wild tribes of India.<a id="FNanchor_2282_2282" href="#Footnote_2282_2282" class="fnanchor">2282</a>

the marriage ceremony, whilst the Tangutans,<a id="FNanchor_2286_2286" href="#Footnote_2286_2286" class="fnanchor">2286</a> Samoyedes,<a id="FNanchor_2287_2287" href="#Footnote_2287_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a>
Votyaks,<a id="FNanchor_2288_2288" href="#Footnote_2288_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a> &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_2289_2289" href="#Footnote_2289_2289" class="fnanchor">2289</a> are still in the habit of stealing wives, or elope
with their sweethearts, if the bridegroom cannot afford to pay
the fixed purchase-sum. Among the Laplanders,<a id="FNanchor_2290_2290" href="#Footnote_2290_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a> Esthonians,<a id="FNanchor_2291_2291" href="#Footnote_2291_2291" class="fnanchor">2291</a>
and Finns,<a id="FNanchor_2292_2292" href="#Footnote_2292_2292" class="fnanchor">2292</a> marriage by capture occurred in former days, and
in some parts of Finland symbolical traces of it in the
marriage ceremony have been found in modern times.<a id="FNanchor_2293_2293" href="#Footnote_2293_2293" class="fnanchor">2293</a></p>

<p>The same practice prevailed among the peoples of the
Aryan race. According to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ one of the
eight legal forms of the marriage ceremony was the Râkshasa
rite, <i>i.e.</i>, “the forcible abduction of a maiden from her home,
while she cries out and weeps, after her kinsmen have been
slain or wounded, and their houses broken open.” This rite
was permitted for the Kshatriyas by the sacred tradition.<a id="FNanchor_2294_2294" href="#Footnote_2294_2294" class="fnanchor">2294</a>
According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, marriage by capture
was at one time customary throughout ancient Greece;<a id="FNanchor_2295_2295" href="#Footnote_2295_2295" class="fnanchor">2295</a> and,
as Plutarch informs us, it was retained by the Spartans as an
important symbol in the marriage ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_2296_2296" href="#Footnote_2296_2296" class="fnanchor">2296</a> Even now, according
to Sakellarios, capture of wives occasionally occurs in
Greece.<a id="FNanchor_2297_2297" href="#Footnote_2297_2297" class="fnanchor">2297</a> Among the Romans, the bride fled to the lap of her
mother, and was carried off by force by the bridegroom and
his friends.<a id="FNanchor_2298_2298" href="#Footnote_2298_2298" class="fnanchor">2298</a> In the historical age this was a ceremony only,
but at an earlier time the capture seems to have been a
reality. “Les premiers Romains,” says M. Ortolan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span> “d’après
leurs traditions héroïques, ont été obligés de recourir à la surprise
et à la force pour enlever leurs premières femmes.”<a id="FNanchor_2299_2299" href="#Footnote_2299_2299" class="fnanchor">2299</a>
The ancient Teutons frequently captured women for wives.<a id="FNanchor_2300_2300" href="#Footnote_2300_2300" class="fnanchor">2300</a>
Speaking of the Scandinavian nations, Olaus Magnus says
that they were continually at war with one another, “propter
raptas virgines aut arripiendas.”<a id="FNanchor_2301_2301" href="#Footnote_2301_2301" class="fnanchor">2301</a> Among the Welsh, on the
morning of the wedding-day, the bridegroom, accompanied
by his friends on horseback, carried off the bride.<a id="FNanchor_2302_2302" href="#Footnote_2302_2302" class="fnanchor">2302</a> The Slavs
in early times, according to Nestor, practised marriage by
capture;<a id="FNanchor_2303_2303" href="#Footnote_2303_2303" class="fnanchor">2303</a> and in the marriage ceremonies of the Russians and
other Slavonian nations, reminiscences of this custom still
survive.<a id="FNanchor_2304_2304" href="#Footnote_2304_2304" class="fnanchor">2304</a> Indeed, among the South Slavonians, capture <i>de
facto</i> was in full force no longer ago than the beginning of the
present century.<a id="FNanchor_2305_2305" href="#Footnote_2305_2305" class="fnanchor">2305</a> According to Olaus Magnus, it prevailed
in Muscovy, Lithuania, and Livonia;<a id="FNanchor_2306_2306" href="#Footnote_2306_2306" class="fnanchor">2306</a> and, according to
Seignior de Gaya, the symbol of it occurred in his time in
Poland, Prussia, and Samogithia.<a id="FNanchor_2307_2307" href="#Footnote_2307_2307" class="fnanchor">2307</a></p>

<p>The list of peoples among whom marriage by capture
occurs, either as a reality or as a symbol, might easily be enlarged.<a id="FNanchor_2308_2308" href="#Footnote_2308_2308" class="fnanchor">2308</a>
There are peoples, however, who seem to have nothing
of the kind. As regards the Chinese, Mr. Jamieson says, “Of
the capture of wives there is, as far as I am aware, historically
no trace, nor is the form to be found among any of the ceremonies
of marriage with which I am acquainted.”<a id="FNanchor_2309_2309" href="#Footnote_2309_2309" class="fnanchor">2309</a> Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
it is doubtful whether the ceremonies given as instances of
symbolical capture are, in every case, survivals of capture
<i>de facto</i>, in the real sense of the term, that is, taking the
woman against not only her own will, but that of her parents.
Mr. Spencer suggests that one origin of the form of capture
may be the resistance of the pursued woman, due to coyness,
partly real and partly assumed;<a id="FNanchor_2310_2310" href="#Footnote_2310_2310" class="fnanchor">2310</a> and, though this suggestion
has been much attacked, it can scarcely be disproved. On
the East Coast of Greenland, according to Dr. Nansen, the
only method of contracting a marriage is still for the man to
go to the girl’s tent, catch her by the hair or anything else
which offers a hold, and drag her off to his dwelling without
further ado. Violent scenes are often the result, as single
women always affect the utmost bashfulness and aversion to
any proposal of marriage, lest they should lose their reputation
for modesty. But “the woman’s relations meanwhile stand
quietly looking on, as the struggle is considered a purely
private affair, and the natural desire of the Greenlander to
stand on a good footing with his neighbour prevents him from
attempting any interference with another’s business.”<a id="FNanchor_2311_2311" href="#Footnote_2311_2311" class="fnanchor">2311</a> Again,
according to Mr. Abercromby, marriage <i>with</i> capture—by
which he understands capture of a bride, associated with
some other form of marriage, such as that by purchase—may
be regarded rather as a result of the innate universal
desire to display courage, than as a survival of a still older
practice of taking women captive in time of war.<a id="FNanchor_2312_2312" href="#Footnote_2312_2312" class="fnanchor">2312</a></p>

<p>Mr. McLennan thinks that marriage by capture arose from
the rule of exogamy. But there are peoples—the Maoris,
Ahts, &amp;c.—among whom this practice occurs or has remained
as a symbol, who are, nevertheless, what Mr. McLennan
would call endogamous. We are not entitled to say that,
“wherever exogamy can be found, we may confidently
expect to find, after due investigation, at least traces of a
system of capture.”<a id="FNanchor_2313_2313" href="#Footnote_2313_2313" class="fnanchor">2313</a> On reckoning up the peoples among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
whom the combination of capture and exogamy is met with,
Dr. Tylor observes that the number, “though enough to show
that they coexist freely, falls short of what would justify the
inference that they are cause and effect.”<a id="FNanchor_2314_2314" href="#Footnote_2314_2314" class="fnanchor">2314</a></p>

<p>It seems to me extremely probable that the practice of
capturing women for wives is due chiefly to the aversion to
close intermarriage—existing, as we have seen, among endogamous
tribes also,—together with the difficulty a savage
man has in procuring a wife in a friendly manner, without
giving compensation for the loss he inflicts on her father.
Being something quite different from the wrestling for wives,
already mentioned as the most primitive method of courtship,
marriage by capture flourished at that stage of social
growth when family ties had become stronger, and man lived
in small groups of nearly related persons, but when the idea
of barter had scarcely occurred to his mind.<a id="FNanchor_2315_2315" href="#Footnote_2315_2315" class="fnanchor">2315</a> From the
universality of the horror of incest, and from the fact that
primitive hordes were in a chronic state of warfare with one
another, the general prevalence of this custom may be easily
explained. But as it is impossible to believe that there ever
was a time when friendly negotiations between families who
could intermarry were altogether unknown, we cannot suppose
that capture was at any period the exclusive form of
contracting marriage, although it may have been the normal
form. In Australia, where marriage by capture takes place
between members of hostile communities only,<a id="FNanchor_2316_2316" href="#Footnote_2316_2316" class="fnanchor">2316</a> we are aware
of no tribe—exogamous or endogamous—living in a state of
absolute isolation. On the contrary, every tribe entertains
constant relations, for the most part amicable, with one, two,
or more tribes; and marriages between their members are the
rule.<a id="FNanchor_2317_2317" href="#Footnote_2317_2317" class="fnanchor">2317</a> Moreover, the custom, prevalent among many savage
tribes, of a husband taking up his abode in his wife’s family
seems to have arisen very early in man’s history. And Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
Tylor’s schedules show that there are in different parts of the
world even twelve or thirteen well-marked exogamous peoples
among whom this habit occurs.<a id="FNanchor_2318_2318" href="#Footnote_2318_2318" class="fnanchor">2318</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As appears from the instances quoted, the practice of
capturing wives is, in the main, a thing of the past. Among
most existing uncivilized peoples a man has, in some way or
other, to give compensation for his bride.<a id="FNanchor_2319_2319" href="#Footnote_2319_2319" class="fnanchor">2319</a> Marriage by
capture has been succeeded by marriage by purchase.</p>

<p>The simplest way of purchasing a wife is no doubt to give
a kinswoman in exchange for her. “The Australian male,”
says Mr. Curr, “almost invariably obtains his wife or wives,
either as a survivor of a married brother, or in exchange for
his sisters, or later on in life for his daughters.”<a id="FNanchor_2320_2320" href="#Footnote_2320_2320" class="fnanchor">2320</a> A similar
exchange is sometimes effected in Sumatra.<a id="FNanchor_2321_2321" href="#Footnote_2321_2321" class="fnanchor">2321</a></p>

<p>Much more common is the custom of obtaining a wife
by services rendered to her father. The man goes to live
with the family of the girl for a certain time, during
which he works as a servant. This practice, with which
Hebrew tradition has familiarized us, is widely diffused
among the uncivilized races of America,<a id="FNanchor_2322_2322" href="#Footnote_2322_2322" class="fnanchor">2322</a> Africa,<a id="FNanchor_2323_2323" href="#Footnote_2323_2323" class="fnanchor">2323</a> Asia,<a id="FNanchor_2324_2324" href="#Footnote_2324_2324" class="fnanchor">2324</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
the Indian Archipelago.<a id="FNanchor_2325_2325" href="#Footnote_2325_2325" class="fnanchor">2325</a> Often it is only those men who are
too poor to pay cash that serve in the father-in-law’s house
till they have given an equivalent in labour; but sometimes
not even money can save the bridegroom from this sort of
servitude.<a id="FNanchor_2326_2326" href="#Footnote_2326_2326" class="fnanchor">2326</a> In some cases he has to serve his time before he
is allowed to marry the girl; in others he gets her in advance.
Again, among several peoples, already mentioned, the man
goes over to the woman’s family or tribe to live there for
ever; but Dr. Starcke suggests that this custom has a different
origin from the other, being an expression of the strong
clan sentiment, and not a question of gain.<a id="FNanchor_2327_2327" href="#Footnote_2327_2327" class="fnanchor">2327</a></p>

<p>According to Mr. Spencer, the obtaining of wives by
services rendered, instead of by property paid, constitutes
a higher form of marriage, and is developed along with the
industrial type of society. “This modification,” he says,
“practicable with difficulty among rude predatory tribes
becomes more practicable as there arise established industries
affording spheres in which services may be rendered.”<a id="FNanchor_2328_2328" href="#Footnote_2328_2328" class="fnanchor">2328</a>
But it should be noticed that, even at a very low stage of civilization,
a man may help his father-in-law in fishing and hunting,
whilst industrial work promotes accumulation of property,
and consequently makes it easier for the man to acquire his
wife by real purchase. We find also the practice of serving
for wives prevalent among such rude races as the Fuegians and
the Bushmans; and, in the ‘Eyrbyggja Saga,’ Vîgstyr says to
the berserk Halli, who asked for the hand of his daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Âsdî, “As you are a poor man, I shall do as the ancients did
and let you deserve your marriage by hard work.”<a id="FNanchor_2329_2329" href="#Footnote_2329_2329" class="fnanchor">2329</a> It seems
then, almost probable that marriage by services is a more
archaic form than marriage by purchase; but generally they
occur simultaneously.</p>

<p>The most common compensation for a bride is property
paid to her owner. Her price varies indefinitely. A pretty,
healthy, and able-bodied girl commands of course a better
price than one who is ugly and weak;<a id="FNanchor_2330_2330" href="#Footnote_2330_2330" class="fnanchor">2330</a> a girl of rank, a better
price than one who is mean and poor;<a id="FNanchor_2331_2331" href="#Footnote_2331_2331" class="fnanchor">2331</a> a virgin, generally a
better than a widow or a repudiated wife.<a id="FNanchor_2332_2332" href="#Footnote_2332_2332" class="fnanchor">2332</a> Among the
Californian Karok, for instance, a wife is seldom purchased
for less than half a string of dentalium shell, but “when she
belongs to an aristocratic family, is pretty, and skillful in
making acorn-bread and weaving baskets, she sometimes costs
as high as two strings.”<a id="FNanchor_2333_2333" href="#Footnote_2333_2333" class="fnanchor">2333</a> The bride-price however, varies
most according to the circumstances of the parties, and
according to the value set on female labour. In British
Columbia and Vancouver Island, the value of the articles
given for the bride ranges from £20 to £40 sterling.<a id="FNanchor_2334_2334" href="#Footnote_2334_2334" class="fnanchor">2334</a> The
Indians of Oregon buy their wives for horses, blankets, or
buffalo robes.<a id="FNanchor_2335_2335" href="#Footnote_2335_2335" class="fnanchor">2335</a> Among the Shastika in California, “a wife is
purchased of her father for shell-money or horses, ten or
twelve cayuse ponies being paid for a maid of great attractions.”<a id="FNanchor_2336_2336" href="#Footnote_2336_2336" class="fnanchor">2336</a>
Again, the Navajos of New Mexico consider twelve
horses so exorbitant a price for a wife, that it is paid only for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
“one possessing unusual qualifications, such as beauty, industry,
and skill in their necessary employments”;<a id="FNanchor_2337_2337" href="#Footnote_2337_2337" class="fnanchor">2337</a> and the
Patagonians give mares, horses, or silver ornaments for the
bride.<a id="FNanchor_2338_2338" href="#Footnote_2338_2338" class="fnanchor">2338</a></p>

<p>In Africa, not horses but cattle are considered the most
proper equivalent for a good wife. Among the Kaffirs, three,
five, or ten cows are a low price, twenty or thirty a rather
high; but, according to Barrow, a man frequently obtained a
wife for an ox or a couple of cows.<a id="FNanchor_2339_2339" href="#Footnote_2339_2339" class="fnanchor">2339</a> The Damaras are so
poor a people that they are often glad to take one cow for
a daughter.<a id="FNanchor_2340_2340" href="#Footnote_2340_2340" class="fnanchor">2340</a> Among the Banyai, many heads of cattle or
goats are given to induce the parents of the girl “to give her
up,” as it is termed, <i>i.e.</i>, to forgo all claim on her offspring,
for if nothing is given, the family from which she comes can
claim the children as part of itself.<a id="FNanchor_2341_2341" href="#Footnote_2341_2341" class="fnanchor">2341</a> In Uganda, the ordinary
price of a wife is either three or four bullocks, six sewing
needles, or a small box of percussion caps, but Mr. Wilson
was often offered one in exchange for a coat or a pair of
shoes.<a id="FNanchor_2342_2342" href="#Footnote_2342_2342" class="fnanchor">2342</a> In the Mangoni country, two skins of a buck are
considered a fair price,<a id="FNanchor_2343_2343" href="#Footnote_2343_2343" class="fnanchor">2343</a> and among the Negroes of Bondo, a
goat;<a id="FNanchor_2344_2344" href="#Footnote_2344_2344" class="fnanchor">2344</a> whereas, among the Mandingoes, as we are told by
Caillié, no wife is to be had otherwise than by the presentation
of slaves to the parents of the mistress.<a id="FNanchor_2345_2345" href="#Footnote_2345_2345" class="fnanchor">2345</a></p>

<p>The Chulims paid from five to fifty roubles for a wife, the
Turalinzes usually from five to ten.<a id="FNanchor_2346_2346" href="#Footnote_2346_2346" class="fnanchor">2346</a> Rich Bashkirs pay sometimes
even 3,000 roubles, but the poorest may buy a wife for
a cart-load of wood or hay.<a id="FNanchor_2347_2347" href="#Footnote_2347_2347" class="fnanchor">2347</a> In Tartary, parents sell a
daughter for some horses, oxen, sheep, or pounds of butter;
among the Samoyedes and Ostyaks, for a certain number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
reindeer.<a id="FNanchor_2348_2348" href="#Footnote_2348_2348" class="fnanchor">2348</a> Among the Indian Kisáns, “two baskets of rice
and a rupee in cash constitute the compensatory offering
given to the parents of the girl.”<a id="FNanchor_2349_2349" href="#Footnote_2349_2349" class="fnanchor">2349</a> Among the Mishmis, a
rich man gives for a wife twenty mithuns (a kind of oxen),
but a poor man can get a wife for a pig.<a id="FNanchor_2350_2350" href="#Footnote_2350_2350" class="fnanchor">2350</a> In Timor-laut,
according to Mr. Forbes, “no wife can be purchased without
elephants’ tusks.”<a id="FNanchor_2351_2351" href="#Footnote_2351_2351" class="fnanchor">2351</a> In the Caroline Islands, “the man makes
a present to the father of the girl whom he marries, consisting
of fruits, fish, and similar things!”<a id="FNanchor_2352_2352" href="#Footnote_2352_2352" class="fnanchor">2352</a> In Samoa, the bride-price
included canoes, pigs, and foreign property of any kind
which might fall into their hands;<a id="FNanchor_2353_2353" href="#Footnote_2353_2353" class="fnanchor">2353</a> and, among the Fijians,
“the usual price is a whale’s tooth, or a musket.”<a id="FNanchor_2354_2354" href="#Footnote_2354_2354" class="fnanchor">2354</a></p>

<p>Among some peoples marriage may take place on credit,
though, generally, the wife and her children cannot leave the
parental home until the price is paid in full.<a id="FNanchor_2355_2355" href="#Footnote_2355_2355" class="fnanchor">2355</a> In Unyoro,
according to Emin Pasha, when a poor man is unable to procure
the cattle required for his marriage at once, he may, by
agreement with the bride’s father, pay them by instalments;
the children, however, born in the meantime belong to the
wife’s father, and each of them must be redeemed with a
cow.<a id="FNanchor_2356_2356" href="#Footnote_2356_2356" class="fnanchor">2356</a></p>

<p>Marriage by exchange or purchase is not only generally
prevalent among existing lower races; it occurs, or formerly
occurred, among civilized nations as well. In Central
America and Peru, a man had to serve for his bride.<a id="FNanchor_2357_2357" href="#Footnote_2357_2357" class="fnanchor">2357</a> In
China, a present is given by the father of the suitor, the
amount of which is not left to the goodwill of the parties, as
the term “present” would suggest, but is exactly stipulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
for by the negotiators of the marriage; hence, as Mr.
Jamieson remarks, it is no doubt a survival of the time when
the transaction was one of ordinary bargain.<a id="FNanchor_2358_2358" href="#Footnote_2358_2358" class="fnanchor">2358</a> In Japan, the
proposed husband sends certain prescribed presents to his
future bride, and this sending of presents forms one of the
most important parts of the marriage ceremony. In fact,
when once the presents have been sent and accepted, the contract
is completed, and neither party can retract. Mr. Küchler
says he has been unable to find out the exact meaning of
these presents: the native books on marriage are silent on
the subject, and the Japanese themselves have no other explanation
to give than that the custom has been handed down
from ancient times.<a id="FNanchor_2359_2359" href="#Footnote_2359_2359" class="fnanchor">2359</a> But from the facts recorded in the next
chapter it is evident that the sending of presents is a relic of
a previous custom of marrying by purchase.</p>

<p>In all branches of the Semitic race men had to buy or
serve for their wives, the “mohar” or “mahr” being originally
the same as a purchase-sum.<a id="FNanchor_2360_2360" href="#Footnote_2360_2360" class="fnanchor">2360</a> In the Books of Ruth and
Hosea, the bridegroom actually says that he has bought the
bride;<a id="FNanchor_2361_2361" href="#Footnote_2361_2361" class="fnanchor">2361</a> and the modern Jews, according to Michaelis, have a
sham purchase among their marriage ceremonies, which is
called “marrying by the penny.”<a id="FNanchor_2362_2362" href="#Footnote_2362_2362" class="fnanchor">2362</a> In Mohammedan countries
marriage differs but little from a real purchase.<a id="FNanchor_2363_2363" href="#Footnote_2363_2363" class="fnanchor">2363</a> The same
custom prevailed among the Chaldeans, Babylonians,<a id="FNanchor_2364_2364" href="#Footnote_2364_2364" class="fnanchor">2364</a> and
Assyrians.<a id="FNanchor_2365_2365" href="#Footnote_2365_2365" class="fnanchor">2365</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the ancient Finns, the Finnish philologist and
traveller, Castrén, remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span> “There are many reasons for
believing that a cap full of silver and gold was one of the
best proxies in wooing among our ancestors.”<a id="FNanchor_2366_2366" href="#Footnote_2366_2366" class="fnanchor">2366</a> Evident
traces of marriage by purchase are, indeed, found in the ‘Kalevala’
and the ‘Kanteletar’;<a id="FNanchor_2367_2367" href="#Footnote_2367_2367" class="fnanchor">2367</a> and, in parts of Finland, symbols
of it are still left in the marriage ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_2368_2368" href="#Footnote_2368_2368" class="fnanchor">2368</a> Among the East
Finnish peoples, marriage by purchase exists even now, or
did so till quite lately.<a id="FNanchor_2369_2369" href="#Footnote_2369_2369" class="fnanchor">2369</a></p>

<p>Wife purchase, as Dr. Winternitz remarks, was the basis
of Indo-European marriage before the separation of peoples
took place.<a id="FNanchor_2370_2370" href="#Footnote_2370_2370" class="fnanchor">2370</a> The Hindu bride, in Vedic times, had to be
won by rich presents to the future father-in-law;<a id="FNanchor_2371_2371" href="#Footnote_2371_2371" class="fnanchor">2371</a> and one
of the eight forms of marriage mentioned, though disapproved
of, by Manu—the Âsura form—was marriage by
purchase. According to Dubois, to marry and to buy a
wife are in India synonymous terms.<a id="FNanchor_2372_2372" href="#Footnote_2372_2372" class="fnanchor">2372</a> Aristotle tells us that
the ancient Greeks were in the habit of purchasing wives,<a id="FNanchor_2373_2373" href="#Footnote_2373_2373" class="fnanchor">2373</a>
and in the Homeric age a maid was called “ἀλφεσίβοια,” <i>i.e.</i>,
one “who yields her parents many oxen as presents from her
suitor.” Among the Thracians, according to Herodotus,
marriage was contracted by purchase.<a id="FNanchor_2374_2374" href="#Footnote_2374_2374" class="fnanchor">2374</a> So also throughout
Teutonic antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_2375_2375" href="#Footnote_2375_2375" class="fnanchor">2375</a> The ancient Scandinavians believed
that even the gods had bought their wives.<a id="FNanchor_2376_2376" href="#Footnote_2376_2376" class="fnanchor">2376</a> In Germany,
the expression “to purchase a wife” was in use till the end
of the Middle Ages, and we find the same term in Christian
IV.'s Norwegian Law of 1604.<a id="FNanchor_2377_2377" href="#Footnote_2377_2377" class="fnanchor">2377</a> As late as the middle of the
sixteenth century the English preserved in their marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
ritual traces of this ancient legal procedure;<a id="FNanchor_2378_2378" href="#Footnote_2378_2378" class="fnanchor">2378</a> whilst in Thuringia,
according to Franz Schmidt, the betrothal ceremony
even to this day indicates its former occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_2379_2379" href="#Footnote_2379_2379" class="fnanchor">2379</a></p>

<p>Purchase, as Dr. Schrader remarks, cannot with equal certainty
be established as the oldest form of marriage on
Roman soil.<a id="FNanchor_2380_2380" href="#Footnote_2380_2380" class="fnanchor">2380</a> But the symbolical process of <i>coemptio</i>—the
form of marriage among the plebeians—preserved a reminiscence
of the original custom in force if not at Rome, at least
among the ancestors of the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_2381_2381" href="#Footnote_2381_2381" class="fnanchor">2381</a> In Ireland and Wales,
in ancient times, the bride-price consisted usually of articles
of gold, silver, and bronze, sometimes even of land.<a id="FNanchor_2382_2382" href="#Footnote_2382_2382" class="fnanchor">2382</a> The
Slavs, also, used to buy their wives;<a id="FNanchor_2383_2383" href="#Footnote_2383_2383" class="fnanchor">2383</a> and, among the South
Slavonians, the custom of purchasing the bride still partially
prevails, or recently did so. In Servia, at the beginning of
the present century, the price of girls reached such a height
that Black George limited it to one ducat.<a id="FNanchor_2384_2384" href="#Footnote_2384_2384" class="fnanchor">2384</a></p>

<p>In spite of this general prevalence of marriage by purchase,
we have no evidence that it is a stage through which every
race has passed. It must be observed, first, that in sundry
tribes the presents given by the bridegroom are intended
not exactly to compensate the parents for the bride, but
rather to dispose them favourably to the match. Colonel
Dalton says, for example, that, among the Pádams, one of the
lowest peoples of India, it is customary for a lover to show
his inclinations whilst courting by presenting his sweetheart
and her parents with small delicacies, such as field mice and
squirrels, though the parents seldom interfere with the young
couple’s designs, and it would be regarded as an indelible disgrace
to barter a child’s happiness for money.<a id="FNanchor_2385_2385" href="#Footnote_2385_2385" class="fnanchor">2385</a> The Ainos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
of Yesso, says Mr. Bickmore, “do not buy their wives, but
make presents to the parents of saki, tobacco, and fish;”<a id="FNanchor_2386_2386" href="#Footnote_2386_2386" class="fnanchor">2386</a> and
the amount of these gifts is never settled beforehand.<a id="FNanchor_2387_2387" href="#Footnote_2387_2387" class="fnanchor">2387</a> The
game and fruits given by the bridegroom immediately before
marriage, among the Puris, Coroados, and Coropos, seem to
v. Martius to be rather a proof of his ability to keep a
wife than a means of exchange; whereas the more civilized
tribes of the Brazilian aborigines carry on an actual trade
in women.<a id="FNanchor_2388_2388" href="#Footnote_2388_2388" class="fnanchor">2388</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Yukonikhotana, a tribe of Alaska, Petroff
states that the custom of purchasing wives does not exist
among them.<a id="FNanchor_2389_2389" href="#Footnote_2389_2389" class="fnanchor">2389</a> The Californian Wintun, who rank among
the lower types of the race, generally pay nothing for their
brides.<a id="FNanchor_2390_2390" href="#Footnote_2390_2390" class="fnanchor">2390</a> The Niam-Niam and some other African peoples,<a id="FNanchor_2391_2391" href="#Footnote_2391_2391" class="fnanchor">2391</a>
most of the Chittagong Hill tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2392_2392" href="#Footnote_2392_2392" class="fnanchor">2392</a> the aboriginal inhabitants
of Kola and Kobroor, of the Aru Archipelago, who live
in trees or caves,<a id="FNanchor_2393_2393" href="#Footnote_2393_2393" class="fnanchor">2393</a> and apparently also the Andamanese
are in the habit of marrying without making any payment
for the bride. Among the Veddahs, according to
M. Le Mesurier, no marriage presents are given on either
side,<a id="FNanchor_2394_2394" href="#Footnote_2394_2394" class="fnanchor">2394</a> but Mr. Hartshorne states that “a marriage is attended
with no ceremony beyond the presentation of some food to
the parents of the bride.”<a id="FNanchor_2395_2395" href="#Footnote_2395_2395" class="fnanchor">2395</a></p>

<p>In Ponapé, says Dr. Finsch, marriage is not based on purchase;<a id="FNanchor_2396_2396" href="#Footnote_2396_2396" class="fnanchor">2396</a>
but this is contrary to the general custom in the
Carolines,<a id="FNanchor_2397_2397" href="#Footnote_2397_2397" class="fnanchor">2397</a> as also in the adjacent Pelew Islands,<a id="FNanchor_2398_2398" href="#Footnote_2398_2398" class="fnanchor">2398</a> where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
women are bought as wives by means of presents to the
father. In the Kingsmill Group, according to Wilkes, “a
wife is never bought, but it is generally supposed that each
party will contribute something towards the household stock.”<a id="FNanchor_2399_2399" href="#Footnote_2399_2399" class="fnanchor">2399</a>
With regard to the Hawaiians, Ellis remarks, “We are not
aware that the parents of the woman received anything from
the husband, or gave any dowry with the wife.”<a id="FNanchor_2400_2400" href="#Footnote_2400_2400" class="fnanchor">2400</a> And Mr.
Angas even asserts that the practice of purchasing wives is
not generally adopted in Polynesia.<a id="FNanchor_2401_2401" href="#Footnote_2401_2401" class="fnanchor">2401</a> But the statement is
doubtful, as, at least in Samoa,<a id="FNanchor_2402_2402" href="#Footnote_2402_2402" class="fnanchor">2402</a> Tahiti,<a id="FNanchor_2403_2403" href="#Footnote_2403_2403" class="fnanchor">2403</a> and Nukahiva,<a id="FNanchor_2404_2404" href="#Footnote_2404_2404" class="fnanchor">2404</a> the
bridegroom gains the bride by presents to her father. And
in Melanesia marriage by purchase is certainly universal.<a id="FNanchor_2405_2405" href="#Footnote_2405_2405" class="fnanchor">2405</a>
Among the South Australian Kurnai, according to Mr.
Howitt, marriages were brought about “most frequently by
elopement, less frequently by capture, and least frequently by
exchange or by gift.”<a id="FNanchor_2406_2406" href="#Footnote_2406_2406" class="fnanchor">2406</a></p>

<p>Purchase of wives may, with even more reason than
marriage by capture, be said to form a general stage in the
social history of man. Although the two practices often
occur simultaneously, the former has, as a rule, succeeded the
latter, as barter in general has followed upon robbery. The
more recent character of marriage by purchase appears clearly
from the fact that marriage by capture very frequently
occurs as a symbol where marriage by purchase occurs as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
reality. Moreover, there can be little doubt that barter and
commerce are comparatively late inventions of man.</p>

<p>Dr. Peschel, indeed, contends that barter existed in those
ages in which we find the earliest signs of our race. But we
have no evidence that it was in this way that the cave-dwellers
of Périgord, of the reindeer period, obtained the rock crystals,
the Atlantic shells, and the horns of the Polish Saiga antelope,
which have been found in their settlements; and we may not
in any case, conclude that “commerce has existed in all ages,
and among all inhabitants of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_2407_2407" href="#Footnote_2407_2407" class="fnanchor">2407</a> There are even in
modern times instances of savage peoples who seem to have a
very vague idea of barter, or perhaps none at all. Concerning
certain Solomon Islanders, Labillardière states, “We could
not learn whether these people are in the habit of making
exchanges; but it is very certain that it was impossible for
us to obtain anything from them in this way; ... yet they
were very eager to receive everything that we gave them.”<a id="FNanchor_2408_2408" href="#Footnote_2408_2408" class="fnanchor">2408</a>
For some time after Captain Weddell began to associate with
the Fuegians, they gave him any small article he expressed
a wish for, without asking any return; but afterwards they
“acquired an idea of barter.”<a id="FNanchor_2409_2409" href="#Footnote_2409_2409" class="fnanchor">2409</a> Nor did the Australians whom
Cook saw, and the Patagonians visited by Captain Wallis in
1766, understand traffic, though they now understand it.<a id="FNanchor_2410_2410" href="#Footnote_2410_2410" class="fnanchor">2410</a>
Again, with regard to the Andamanese Mr. Man remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
“They set no fixed value on their various properties,
and rarely make or procure anything with the express
object of disposing of it in barter. Apparently they
prefer to regard their transactions as presentations, for their
mode of negotiating is to <i>give</i> such objects as are desired by
another in the hope of receiving in return something for which
they have expressed a wish, it being tacitly understood that
unless otherwise mentioned beforehand, no ‘present’ is to be
accepted without an equivalent being rendered. The natural
consequence of this system is that most of the quarrels which
so frequently occur among them originate in failure on the
part of the recipient in making such a return as had been
confidently expected.”<a id="FNanchor_2411_2411" href="#Footnote_2411_2411" class="fnanchor">2411</a> It must also be noted that those
uncivilized peoples among whom marriage by purchase does
not occur are, for the most part, exceedingly rude races.</p>

<p>As M. Koenigswarter<a id="FNanchor_2412_2412" href="#Footnote_2412_2412" class="fnanchor">2412</a> and Mr. Spencer<a id="FNanchor_2413_2413" href="#Footnote_2413_2413" class="fnanchor">2413</a> have suggested,
the transition from marriage by capture to marriage by
purchase was probably brought about in the following way:
abduction, in spite of parents, was the primary form; then
there came the offering of compensation to escape vengeance;
and this grew eventually into the making of presents beforehand.
Thus, among the Ahts, according to Mr. Sproat, when
a man steals a wife, a purchase follows, “as the friends of the
woman must be pacified with presents.”<a id="FNanchor_2414_2414" href="#Footnote_2414_2414" class="fnanchor">2414</a> In New Guinea<a id="FNanchor_2415_2415" href="#Footnote_2415_2415" class="fnanchor">2415</a>
and Bali,<a id="FNanchor_2416_2416" href="#Footnote_2416_2416" class="fnanchor">2416</a> as also among the Chukmas<a id="FNanchor_2417_2417" href="#Footnote_2417_2417" class="fnanchor">2417</a> and Araucanians,<a id="FNanchor_2418_2418" href="#Footnote_2418_2418" class="fnanchor">2418</a> it
often happens that the bridegroom carries off, or elopes with,
his bride, and afterwards pays a compensation-price to her
parents. Among the Bodo and Mech, who still preserve the
form of forcible abduction in their marriage ceremony, the
successful lover, after having captured the girl, gives a feast
to the bride’s friends and with a present conciliates the father,
who is supposed to be incensed.<a id="FNanchor_2419_2419" href="#Footnote_2419_2419" class="fnanchor">2419</a> The same is reported of
the Maoris,<a id="FNanchor_2420_2420" href="#Footnote_2420_2420" class="fnanchor">2420</a> whilst among the Tangutans, according to
Prejevalsky, the ravisher who has stolen his neighbour’s wife
pays the husband a good sum as compensation, but keeps the
wife.<a id="FNanchor_2421_2421" href="#Footnote_2421_2421" class="fnanchor">2421</a></p>

<p>It is a matter of no importance in this connection that
among certain peoples, the price of the bride is paid not to
the father, but to some other nearly related person, especially
an uncle,<a id="FNanchor_2422_2422" href="#Footnote_2422_2422" class="fnanchor">2422</a> or to some other relatives as well as to the father.<a id="FNanchor_2423_2423" href="#Footnote_2423_2423" class="fnanchor">2423</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
In any case the price is to be regarded as a compensation for
the loss sustained in the giving up of the girl, and as a
remuneration for the expenses incurred in her maintenance
till the time of her marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2424_2424" href="#Footnote_2424_2424" class="fnanchor">2424</a> Sometimes, as among several
negro peoples, daughters are trained for the purpose of being
disposed of at a profit; but this is a modern invention, irreconcilable
with savage ideas. Thus, among the Kafirs, the
practice of making an express bargain about women hardly
prevailed in the first quarter of this century, and the verb
applied to the act of giving cattle for a girl, according to Mr.
Shooter, involves not the idea of an actual trade, but rather
that of reward for her birth and nurture.<a id="FNanchor_2425_2425" href="#Footnote_2425_2425" class="fnanchor">2425</a></p>

<p>To most savages there seems nothing objectionable in
marriage by purchase. On the contrary, Mr. Bancroft states
that the Indians in Columbia consider it in the highest degree
disgraceful to the girl’s family, if she is given away without a
price;<a id="FNanchor_2426_2426" href="#Footnote_2426_2426" class="fnanchor">2426</a> and, in certain tribes of California, “the children of a
woman for whom no money was paid are accounted no better
than bastards, and the whole family are contemned.”<a id="FNanchor_2427_2427" href="#Footnote_2427_2427" class="fnanchor">2427</a> It was
left for a higher civilization to raise women from this state
of debasement. In the next chapter we shall consider the
process by which marriage ceased to be a purchase contract,
and woman an object of trade.</p>

<small>THE DECAY OF MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE. THE MARRIAGE
PORTION</small></h2>


<p>It has often been said that the position of women is the
surest gauge of a people’s civilization. This assertion, though
not absolutely, is approximately true. The evolution of
altruism is one of the chief elements in human progress, and
consideration for the weaker sex is one of the chief elements
in the evolution of altruism.</p>

<p>According as more elevated ideas regarding women grew
up among the so-called civilized peoples, the practice of purchasing
wives was gradually abandoned, and came to be
looked upon as infamous. The wealthier classes took the
first step, and poorer and ruder persons followed their
example. It is of no little interest to follow the course of
this process.</p>

<p>In India, in ancient times, the Âsura form, or marriage by
purchase, was lawful for all the four castes. Afterwards it
fell into disrepute, and was prohibited among the Brahmans
and Kshatriyas, but it was approved of in the case of a
Vaiśya and of a Śudra. Manu forbade it altogether.<a id="FNanchor_2428_2428" href="#Footnote_2428_2428" class="fnanchor">2428</a> “No
father who knows the law,” he says, “must take even the
smallest gratuity for his daughter; for a man who, through
avarice, takes a gratuity, is a seller of his offspring.”<a id="FNanchor_2429_2429" href="#Footnote_2429_2429" class="fnanchor">2429</a> Purchase
survived as a symbol only in the Ârsha form, according
to which the bridegroom sent a cow and a bull or two pairs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
the bride’s father.<a id="FNanchor_2430_2430" href="#Footnote_2430_2430" class="fnanchor">2430</a> Manu expressly condemns those who call
this gift a gratuity;<a id="FNanchor_2431_2431" href="#Footnote_2431_2431" class="fnanchor">2431</a> hence the Ârsha form was counted by
Manu and other lawgivers as one of the legitimate modes of
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2432_2432" href="#Footnote_2432_2432" class="fnanchor">2432</a> The Greeks of the historical age had ceased to
buy their wives; and in Rome, <i>confarreatio</i>, which suggested
no idea of purchase, was in the very earliest known time the
form of marriage in force among the patricians. Among clients
and plebeians also, the purchase of wives came to an end in remote
antiquity, surviving as a mere symbol in their <i>coemptio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2433_2433" href="#Footnote_2433_2433" class="fnanchor">2433</a>
Among the Germans, according to Grimm, it was only Christianity
that abolished marriage by purchase.<a id="FNanchor_2434_2434" href="#Footnote_2434_2434" class="fnanchor">2434</a> Laferrière and
Koenigswarter think it prevailed among the Saxons as late as
the reign of Charles the Great, and that in England it was
prohibited by Cnut.<a id="FNanchor_2435_2435" href="#Footnote_2435_2435" class="fnanchor">2435</a> In <i>Lex Alamannorum</i>, <i>Lex Ripuariorum</i>,
‘Grâgâs,’ and the Norwegian laws, real purchase money is
not spoken of; and there is reason to believe that the
“mundr,” mentioned in the elder ‘Gula-lag’ had gradually
lost its original meaning of price for a bride.<a id="FNanchor_2436_2436" href="#Footnote_2436_2436" class="fnanchor">2436</a></p>

<p>In the Talmudic law, the purchase of wives appears as
merely symbolic, the bride-price being fixed at a nominal
amount.<a id="FNanchor_2437_2437" href="#Footnote_2437_2437" class="fnanchor">2437</a> The Mohammedan “mahr” is also frequently merely
nominal.<a id="FNanchor_2438_2438" href="#Footnote_2438_2438" class="fnanchor">2438</a> Among the Finns, the purchase of wives had
disappeared in the remote times when their popular songs
originated.<a id="FNanchor_2439_2439" href="#Footnote_2439_2439" class="fnanchor">2439</a> Though it still was usual for a bridegroom to
give presents to his bride and her parents, passages in
the songs indicate that not even the memory of a real
purchase survived.<a id="FNanchor_2440_2440" href="#Footnote_2440_2440" class="fnanchor">2440</a> In China, although marriage presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
correspond exactly to purchase-money in a contract of sale,
the people will not hear of their being called a “price”;<a id="FNanchor_2441_2441" href="#Footnote_2441_2441" class="fnanchor">2441</a>
which shows that, among them also, some feeling of shame
is attached to the idea of selling a daughter.</p>

<p>We may discern two different ways in which this gradual
disappearance of marriage by purchase has taken place. It
has been suggested that the sum with which the bridegroom
bought the bride became a payment for the guardianship of
her.<a id="FNanchor_2442_2442" href="#Footnote_2442_2442" class="fnanchor">2442</a> However this may be, the purchase-money became in
time smaller and smaller, and took in many cases the form
of more or less arbitrary presents. Only a relic of the ancient
custom, as we have seen, was left, often appearing as a sham sale
in the marriage ceremonies. Another mode of preserving the
symbol of sale was the receipt of a gift of real value, which
was immediately returned to the giver. This arrangement is
said by Âpastamba to have been prescribed by the Vedas “in
order to fulfil the law”—that is, the ancient law by which the
binding form of marriage was a sale.<a id="FNanchor_2443_2443" href="#Footnote_2443_2443" class="fnanchor">2443</a> Generally, however,
not the same but another gift is presented in return. Thus,
at Athens, at some time which cannot be determined, but
which was undoubtedly earlier than the age of Solon, the
dower in the modern sense arose; and, as has been suggested,<a id="FNanchor_2444_2444" href="#Footnote_2444_2444" class="fnanchor">2444</a>
this portioning of the bride by her father or guardian
very probably implied originally a return of the price paid.
Again, in China, exchange of presents takes place between
the guardians of the bridegroom and the guardians of the
bride; and this exchange forms the subject of a long section
in the penal code, for, “the marriage articles and betrothal
presents once exchanged, the parties are considered irrevocably
engaged.”<a id="FNanchor_2445_2445" href="#Footnote_2445_2445" class="fnanchor">2445</a> In Japan, the bride gives certain conventional
presents to her future husband and his parents and relatives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
and, as to the value of these presents, she should always be
guided by the value of those brought by the bridegroom.<a id="FNanchor_2446_2446" href="#Footnote_2446_2446" class="fnanchor">2446</a>
Among the ancient Germans, according to Tacitus, the wife
in her turn presented the husband with some kind of arms,
and this mutual exchange of gifts formed the principal bond
of their union.<a id="FNanchor_2447_2447" href="#Footnote_2447_2447" class="fnanchor">2447</a> Grimm also suggests that the meaning of
the Teutonic dowry was partly that of a return gift.<a id="FNanchor_2448_2448" href="#Footnote_2448_2448" class="fnanchor">2448</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the purchase-sum was transformed into
the morning gift and the dotal portion. A part—afterwards
the whole—was given to the bride either directly by the
bridegroom or by her father. Manu says, “When the relatives
do not appropriate for their use the gratuity given, it is
not a sale; in that case the gift is only a token of respect and
of kindness towards the maidens.”<a id="FNanchor_2449_2449" href="#Footnote_2449_2449" class="fnanchor">2449</a> This gift was called
“çulka,” or her fee; but its close connection with a previous
purchase appears from the fact that it passed in a course of
devolution to the woman’s brothers, and one rendering of the
text of Gautama which regulates this succession, even
allowed the fee to go to her brothers during her life.<a id="FNanchor_2450_2450" href="#Footnote_2450_2450" class="fnanchor">2450</a> In
modern India, according to Dubois, men of distinction do
not appropriate the money acquired by giving a daughter
in marriage, but lay it out in jewels, which they present to the
lady on the wedding-day.<a id="FNanchor_2451_2451" href="#Footnote_2451_2451" class="fnanchor">2451</a> Among the Greeks of the Homeric
age, the father did not always keep the wedding-presents for
his own use, but bestowed them, wholly or in part, on the
daughter as her marriage portion. At a later period, the
bridegroom himself gave the presents to his wife, when he
saw her unveiled for the first time, or after the νὺξ
μυστική.<a id="FNanchor_2452_2452" href="#Footnote_2452_2452" class="fnanchor">2452</a> Among the Teutons the same process of development
took place. Originally, the purchase-sum went to the
guardian of the bride, partly, perhaps, to her whole family;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
but by-and-by it came to be considered her own property,<a id="FNanchor_2453_2453" href="#Footnote_2453_2453" class="fnanchor">2453</a> as
Tacitus says, “Dotem non uxor marito sed uxori maritus
offert.”<a id="FNanchor_2454_2454" href="#Footnote_2454_2454" class="fnanchor">2454</a> This was the case among the Scandinavians at the
date of the inditing of their laws, and among the Langobardi
from the seventh century.<a id="FNanchor_2455_2455" href="#Footnote_2455_2455" class="fnanchor">2455</a> “La dot,” says M. Ginoulhiac,
“n’est autre chose que le prix de la coemption en usage dans
la loi salique; elle fut donnée à la femme au lieu de l’être à ses
parents, qui ne reçurent plus que le <i>solidum</i> et <i>denarium</i>, ou
le prix fictif, et après la mort de l’épouse, une partie de la
dot.”<a id="FNanchor_2456_2456" href="#Footnote_2456_2456" class="fnanchor">2456</a> In <i>Lex Alamannorum</i> and <i>Lex Ripuariorum</i>, only a <i>dos</i>
which the wife receives directly from her husband is spoken
of.<a id="FNanchor_2457_2457" href="#Footnote_2457_2457" class="fnanchor">2457</a> And it seems probable that the morning gift, which has
survived very long in Europe,<a id="FNanchor_2458_2458" href="#Footnote_2458_2458" class="fnanchor">2458</a> originated in the purchase-sum,
or formed a part of it,<a id="FNanchor_2459_2459" href="#Footnote_2459_2459" class="fnanchor">2459</a> though it has often been considered
a <i>pretium virginitatis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2460_2460" href="#Footnote_2460_2460" class="fnanchor">2460</a> According to ancient Irish
law, a part of the “coibche,” or bridal gift, went to the bride’s
father, or, if he was dead, to the head of her tribe;<a id="FNanchor_2461_2461" href="#Footnote_2461_2461" class="fnanchor">2461</a> but
another part was given by the bridegroom to the bride herself
after marriage. The same was the case with the Welsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
“cowyll”;<a id="FNanchor_2462_2462" href="#Footnote_2462_2462" class="fnanchor">2462</a> and the Slavonic word for bride-price, “vĕno,”
came to be frequently used for <i>dos</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2463_2463" href="#Footnote_2463_2463" class="fnanchor">2463</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the ancient Babylonians, Herodotus says that
“the marriage portions were furnished by the money paid for
the beautiful damsels.”<a id="FNanchor_2464_2464" href="#Footnote_2464_2464" class="fnanchor">2464</a> Among the Hebrews, as it seems
the “mohar,” or a part of it, was given to the bride herself.<a id="FNanchor_2465_2465" href="#Footnote_2465_2465" class="fnanchor">2465</a>
We read in the Book of Genesis that Abraham’s servant
“brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment,
and gave them to Rebecca: he gave also to her brother
and to her mother precious things.”<a id="FNanchor_2466_2466" href="#Footnote_2466_2466" class="fnanchor">2466</a> Professor Robertson
Smith is inclined to believe that, in Arabia, before Mohammed,
a custom had established itself by which the husband ordinarily
made a gift—under the name of “sadâc”—to his wife upon
marriage, or by which a part of the “mahr” was customarily
set aside for her use.<a id="FNanchor_2467_2467" href="#Footnote_2467_2467" class="fnanchor">2467</a> But under Islam the difference between
“mahr” and “sadâc” disappeared, the price paid to the
father becoming the property of the woman.<a id="FNanchor_2468_2468" href="#Footnote_2468_2468" class="fnanchor">2468</a></p>

<p>But it is not only in the history of the great civilized
nations that we find marriage by purchase falling into decay.
Among several peoples who are still in a savage or semi-civilized
state, the custom of purchasing the wife has been
modified, and of a few it is expressly stated that they consider
such a traffic disgraceful.<a id="FNanchor_2469_2469" href="#Footnote_2469_2469" class="fnanchor">2469</a> The change has taken place
in exactly the same way as we have seen to be the case with
higher races.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the purchase has become more or less a
symbol. In some cases the gift no longer represents the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
actual value of the girl, in others it is followed by a
return gift. Thus, in Oregon, “the wife’s relations always
raise as many horses (or other property) for her dower, as
the bridegroom has sent the parents, but scrupulously take
care not to turn over the same horses or the same articles.”<a id="FNanchor_2470_2470" href="#Footnote_2470_2470" class="fnanchor">2470</a>
The Ahts consider it a point of honour that the purchase-money
given for a woman of rank shall, some time or other, be returned
in a present of equal value.<a id="FNanchor_2471_2471" href="#Footnote_2471_2471" class="fnanchor">2471</a> Similar statements are
made with reference to the Patagonians,<a id="FNanchor_2472_2472" href="#Footnote_2472_2472" class="fnanchor">2472</a> Mishmis,<a id="FNanchor_2473_2473" href="#Footnote_2473_2473" class="fnanchor">2473</a> and certain
tribes in the Indian Archipelago.<a id="FNanchor_2474_2474" href="#Footnote_2474_2474" class="fnanchor">2474</a> Among the Bagobos of the
Philippines, if the newly-married couple are satisfied with
each other, the father of the wife gives the half of the purchase-sum
back to the husband;<a id="FNanchor_2475_2475" href="#Footnote_2475_2475" class="fnanchor">2475</a> whilst, in Saraë, the girl’s father,
at the wedding, has to return even five times the price which
he received from the bridegroom’s father at the espousals, the
return gift, however, becoming the common property of the
married couple.<a id="FNanchor_2476_2476" href="#Footnote_2476_2476" class="fnanchor">2476</a> Among the Badagas of the Neilgherries
also, the return gift is generally greater in value than the sum
which has been paid for her.<a id="FNanchor_2477_2477" href="#Footnote_2477_2477" class="fnanchor">2477</a> Several other peoples contract
marriages by an exchange of presents.<a id="FNanchor_2478_2478" href="#Footnote_2478_2478" class="fnanchor">2478</a></p>

<p>On the other hand there are peoples among whom the
purchase-sum, or a part of it, is given to the bride either by
her father or by the bridegroom himself. But, as this may be
an indirect way of compensating the bridegroom for the price
he has paid, it is in many cases almost impossible to dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>tinguish
between this custom and the one last mentioned. It
is equally hard to distinguish between the cases in which the
bride receives a part of the price from her father, and those
in which she receives a gift from the bridegroom directly.
But perhaps the greatest difficulty of all is to make out whether
the presents obtained from the bridegroom formed originally
a part of the bride-price or were only a means of gaining her
own consent. Among the Eskimo, the lover presents clothes
to the lady, who puts them on, and is thenceforth his wife.<a id="FNanchor_2479_2479" href="#Footnote_2479_2479" class="fnanchor">2479</a>
Among the Dacotahs, men ask for consent to marriage by
sending the price of the girl, and in addition often give
presents to the object of their esteem.<a id="FNanchor_2480_2480" href="#Footnote_2480_2480" class="fnanchor">2480</a> Speaking of the South
American Guanas, Azary says, “Toutes les cérémonies du
mariage se réduisent à un petit présent que le mari fait à sa
prétendue.”<a id="FNanchor_2481_2481" href="#Footnote_2481_2481" class="fnanchor">2481</a> Again, among the Javanese,<a id="FNanchor_2482_2482" href="#Footnote_2482_2482" class="fnanchor">2482</a> Kalmucks,<a id="FNanchor_2483_2483" href="#Footnote_2483_2483" class="fnanchor">2483</a> and
Ahl el Shemál, a Bedouin tribe of Syria,<a id="FNanchor_2484_2484" href="#Footnote_2484_2484" class="fnanchor">2484</a> the money or
articles which the father receives for his daughter are generally
looked upon as a settlement or provision for the wife;
and among the Pelew Islanders,<a id="FNanchor_2485_2485" href="#Footnote_2485_2485" class="fnanchor">2485</a> Mishmis,<a id="FNanchor_2486_2486" href="#Footnote_2486_2486" class="fnanchor">2486</a> Bashkirs,<a id="FNanchor_2487_2487" href="#Footnote_2487_2487" class="fnanchor">2487</a>

bride-price.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From marriage by purchase we have thus reached the
practice of dower, which is apparently the very reverse of it.
But, as we have seen, the marriage portion derives its origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
partly from the purchase of wives. Where, as among the
Marea,<a id="FNanchor_2490_2490" href="#Footnote_2490_2490" class="fnanchor">2490</a> the endowment becomes the exclusive property of
the husband, it is, no doubt, intended to be a compensation
for the bride-price; whilst, among other peoples, money or
goods for which the man has bought his wife are handed over
to her by the father as a marriage portion which, in a certain
way, belongs to her. Yet, as we shall see directly, the dowry
does not in every case spring from a previous purchase.</p>

<p>The marriage portion serves different ends, often indissolubly
mixed up together. It may have the meaning of
a return gift. It may imply that the wife as well as the
husband is expected to contribute to the expenses of the joint
household. It is also very often intended to be a settlement
for the wife in case the marriage be dissolved through the
husband’s death or otherwise. But as, in such instances, the
husband generally has the usufruct of the portion, as long
as the union lasts, it is in many cases impossible to discern
whether the original meaning was that of a return gift to
the man or of a settlement for the woman.</p>

<p>We read in the ‘Laws of Manu,’ “What was given before
the nuptial fire, what was given on the bridal procession, what
was given in token of love, and what was received from her
brother, mother, or father, that is called the sixfold property
of a woman. Such property, as well as a gift subsequent and
what was given to her by her affectionate husband, shall go to
her offspring, even if she dies in the lifetime of her husband.”<a id="FNanchor_2491_2491" href="#Footnote_2491_2491" class="fnanchor">2491</a>
The Hindu law recognizes the dominion of a married woman
over this property (her “strîdhan”),<a id="FNanchor_2492_2492" href="#Footnote_2492_2492" class="fnanchor">2492</a> but the husband has
nevertheless power to use and consume it in case of distress.<a id="FNanchor_2493_2493" href="#Footnote_2493_2493" class="fnanchor">2493</a>
At Athens, the administration of the dower certainly belonged
to the husband, who might defray with it the expenses of the
marriage, and even had a right to alienate the movable objects
forming a part of the marriage portion.<a id="FNanchor_2494_2494" href="#Footnote_2494_2494" class="fnanchor">2494</a> But it did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
become his property. If the marriage tie was dissolved
through divorce or through the husband’s death, the dower
had to be restored to the woman, who, as a security for this
restitution, had a mortgage, consisting generally of a piece of
real property;<a id="FNanchor_2495_2495" href="#Footnote_2495_2495" class="fnanchor">2495</a> or if, in case of divorce, the husband did not
restore the dower, he paid, whilst it was retained, nine oboli
every month as interest.<a id="FNanchor_2496_2496" href="#Footnote_2496_2496" class="fnanchor">2496</a> The Roman <i>dos</i> was intended to
be the wife’s contribution towards the expenses of the
marriage state.<a id="FNanchor_2497_2497" href="#Footnote_2497_2497" class="fnanchor">2497</a> It became the husband’s property, as if
it were a patrimony which he had a right not only to administer,
but even to dispose of independently of the will of his
wife.<a id="FNanchor_2498_2498" href="#Footnote_2498_2498" class="fnanchor">2498</a> This confusion of the dower with the patrimony was
tolerable as long as marriage was contracted for life, but became
very disastrous during the period when divorces were
frequent. At the end of the Republican era, therefore, the
husband’s right to dispose of his wife’s marriage portion was
limited. It had to be restored in case of divorce, as also in
case of the marriage being dissolved through the husband’s
death. The <i>Lex Julia de adulteriis</i> prevented him from
alienating dotal land without the wife’s consent, or mortgaging
it even with her consent; and the legislation of Justinian prevented
alienation with the wife’s consent, and declared the law
on the subject applicable to provincial land.<a id="FNanchor_2499_2499" href="#Footnote_2499_2499" class="fnanchor">2499</a> The general
tradition of the Roman <i>dos</i> was carried on by the Church, the
practical object being to secure for the wife a provision of
which the husband could not wantonly deprive her, and which
would remain to her after his death.<a id="FNanchor_2500_2500" href="#Footnote_2500_2500" class="fnanchor">2500</a> The Roman dotal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
right, more or less modified in the laws of the different
countries, underlies modern European legislation; the husband
generally administers and has the use of his wife’s
dotation, but it remains <i>her</i> property.<a id="FNanchor_2501_2501" href="#Footnote_2501_2501" class="fnanchor">2501</a></p>

<p>Among the Germans of early times, the bride-price which
was handed over to the woman as her marriage portion
became her exclusive property, of which the husband could
not dispose.<a id="FNanchor_2502_2502" href="#Footnote_2502_2502" class="fnanchor">2502</a> Besides this <i>dos</i>, she received from her parents
an endowment, as a sort of compensation for her inheritance,
or as an advance on it. This also was her private property,
at least so far that it went to her if the marriage was dissolved.<a id="FNanchor_2503_2503" href="#Footnote_2503_2503" class="fnanchor">2503</a>
Among the Slavs, the dower seems originally to
have been given to the wife as a security in the event of her
needing independent support; and, among the Poles and
Bohemians, the husband could make no use of it, unless he
left his own goods as a deposit.<a id="FNanchor_2504_2504" href="#Footnote_2504_2504" class="fnanchor">2504</a> In Wales, a woman received
not only a part of the bride-price, “cowyll,” but also a
marriage portion from her father, called “agweddi” (representing
the “tincur” of the Irish), which, during cohabitation,
belonged to husband and wife jointly. In case they separated
before the end of seven years, the wife was to receive this
portion back; and in any case, even if she left her husband
for no reason before the seventh year, she had her “cowyll.”
If the separation took place after this period, the property
which the wife brought with her was divided.<a id="FNanchor_2505_2505" href="#Footnote_2505_2505" class="fnanchor">2505</a></p>

<p>The Hebrews, in early times, generally gave daughters as a
dowry only a part of the “mohar.” Afterwards a woman who
married was endowed with a portion called “nedunia,” of
which the husband had the usufruct as long as the marriage
lasted.<a id="FNanchor_2506_2506" href="#Footnote_2506_2506" class="fnanchor">2506</a> The Mohammedans, as a rule, settle very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
dowers on their wives; and it is generally stipulated that two-thirds
of the dowry shall be paid immediately before the
marriage contract is made, whilst the remaining third is held
in reserve, to be paid to the wife in case of her being divorced
against her own consent, or in case of the husband’s death.<a id="FNanchor_2507_2507" href="#Footnote_2507_2507" class="fnanchor">2507</a>
And whatever property the wife receives from her parents or
any other person on the occasion of her marriage, or otherwise,
is entirely at her own disposal, and not subject to any claim
of her husband or his creditors.<a id="FNanchor_2508_2508" href="#Footnote_2508_2508" class="fnanchor">2508</a> Speaking of newly-married
people among the Mexicans, Acosta says, “When they went
to house they made an inventory of all the man and wife
brought together, of provisions for the house, of land, of
iewells and ornaments, which inventories every father kept,
for if it chanced they made any devorce (as it was common
amongest them when they agree not), they divided their
goods according to the portion that every one brought.”<a id="FNanchor_2509_2509" href="#Footnote_2509_2509" class="fnanchor">2509</a></p>

<p>Among races at a lower stage of civilization<a id="FNanchor_2510_2510" href="#Footnote_2510_2510" class="fnanchor">2510</a> the dowry
commonly subserves a similar end—that is, in case of separation
or divorce, the wife gets back her marriage portion,
though the husband, as it seems in most cases, has the
usufruct of it as long as marriage lasts. But, in savage
life, the dowry plays no important part. Often nothing
of the kind exists,<a id="FNanchor_2511_2511" href="#Footnote_2511_2511" class="fnanchor">2511</a> and, where it does, the portion
generally consists of some food, clothes, household goods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
or other trifles,<a id="FNanchor_2512_2512" href="#Footnote_2512_2512" class="fnanchor">2512</a> and occasionally of cattle.<a id="FNanchor_2513_2513" href="#Footnote_2513_2513" class="fnanchor">2513</a> Ultimately,
as we have seen, the dowry is due to a feeling of respect
and sympathy for the weaker sex, which, on the whole,
is characteristic of a higher civilization.<a id="FNanchor_2514_2514" href="#Footnote_2514_2514" class="fnanchor">2514</a> And, as we
have spoken of a stage of marriage by capture and another
stage of marriage by purchase, we may now speak of a third,
where fathers are bound by law or custom to portion their
daughters.</p>

<p>Thus the Hebrews<a id="FNanchor_2515_2515" href="#Footnote_2515_2515" class="fnanchor">2515</a> and Mahommedans<a id="FNanchor_2516_2516" href="#Footnote_2516_2516" class="fnanchor">2516</a> consider it a
religious duty for a man to give a dower to his daughter.
In Greece the dowry came to be thought almost necessary
to make the distinction between a wife and a concubine
παλλακή;<a id="FNanchor_2517_2517" href="#Footnote_2517_2517" class="fnanchor">2517</a> and Isaeus says that no decent man would
give his legitimate daughter less than a tenth of his property.<a id="FNanchor_2518_2518" href="#Footnote_2518_2518" class="fnanchor">2518</a>
Indeed, so great were the dowers given that, in the time of
Aristotle, nearly two-fifths of the whole territory of Sparta
were supposed to belong to women.<a id="FNanchor_2519_2519" href="#Footnote_2519_2519" class="fnanchor">2519</a> In Rome, even more
than in Greece, the marriage portion became a mark of distinction
for a legitimate wife.<a id="FNanchor_2520_2520" href="#Footnote_2520_2520" class="fnanchor">2520</a> It was the duty of the wife
to provide her husband with <i>dos</i>, and a woman herself had a
legal claim to be provided with a dower by her father or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
other paternal ascendants.<a id="FNanchor_2521_2521" href="#Footnote_2521_2521" class="fnanchor">2521</a> And, though later on, Justinian
in several of his constitutions declares that <i>dos</i> is obligatory
for persons of high rank only,<a id="FNanchor_2522_2522" href="#Footnote_2522_2522" class="fnanchor">2522</a> the old custom did not fall
into desuetude.<a id="FNanchor_2523_2523" href="#Footnote_2523_2523" class="fnanchor">2523</a> The Prussian ‘Landrecht’ still prescribes
that the father, or eventually the mother, shall arrange
about the wedding and fit up the house of the newly-married
couple.<a id="FNanchor_2524_2524" href="#Footnote_2524_2524" class="fnanchor">2524</a> According to the ‘Code Napoléon,’ on the other
hand, parents are not bound to give a dower to their
daughters,<a id="FNanchor_2525_2525" href="#Footnote_2525_2525" class="fnanchor">2525</a> and the same principle is generally adopted by
modern legislation. Yet there is still a strong feeling, especially
in the so-called Latin countries, in favour of dotation.
This feeling, as Sir Henry Maine remarks, is the principal
source of those habits of saving and hoarding, which characterize
the French people, and is probably descended, by
a long chain of succession, from the obligatory provisions of
the marriage law of the Emperor Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_2526_2526" href="#Footnote_2526_2526" class="fnanchor">2526</a></p>

<p>In this course of development, the marriage portion has
often become something quite different from what it was
originally. It has in many cases become a purchase-sum by
means of which a father buys a husband for his daughter,
as formerly a man bought a wife from her father. Euripides,
transferring to the heroic age the practice of his own time,
makes Medea complain that her sex had to purchase husbands
with great sums of money.<a id="FNanchor_2527_2527" href="#Footnote_2527_2527" class="fnanchor">2527</a> “Pars minima est ipsa
puella sui,” the Latin poet sings. And, in our days, a woman
without a marriage portion, unless she has some great natural
attractions, runs the risk of being a spinster for ever. This
state of things naturally grows up in a society where monogamy
is prescribed by law, where the adult women outnumber
the adult men, where many men never marry, and where
married women too often lead an indolent life.</p>

<small>MARRIAGE CEREMONIES AND RITES</small></h2>


<p>Among primitive men marriage was, of course, contracted
without any ceremony whatever; and this is still the case
with many uncivilized peoples. Among the Eskimo, visited
by Captain Hall, “there is no wedding ceremony at all, nor
are there any rejoicings or festivities. The parties simply
come together, and live in their own tupic or igloo.”<a id="FNanchor_2528_2528" href="#Footnote_2528_2528" class="fnanchor">2528</a> The
Bonaks of California, according to Mr. Johnston, have no
marriage ceremony. The man simply speaks to the girl’s
parents, and to the girl herself; and, if the couple live together
for some time harmoniously, they are considered
husband and wife.<a id="FNanchor_2529_2529" href="#Footnote_2529_2529" class="fnanchor">2529</a> Among the Comanches, too, “there is
no marriage ceremony of any description;”<a id="FNanchor_2530_2530" href="#Footnote_2530_2530" class="fnanchor">2530</a> and the same
is said of several other aboriginal tribes of America,<a id="FNanchor_2531_2531" href="#Footnote_2531_2531" class="fnanchor">2531</a> as also
of the Outanatas of New Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_2532_2532" href="#Footnote_2532_2532" class="fnanchor">2532</a> the Solomon Islanders,<a id="FNanchor_2533_2533" href="#Footnote_2533_2533" class="fnanchor">2533</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
and the Tasmanians.<a id="FNanchor_2534_2534" href="#Footnote_2534_2534" class="fnanchor">2534</a> In Australia, wedding ceremonies are
unknown in most tribes, but it is said that in some there
are a few unimportant ones.<a id="FNanchor_2535_2535" href="#Footnote_2535_2535" class="fnanchor">2535</a> In the Hill Tribes of North
Aracan, marriage “is a simple contract unaccompanied
by ceremony.”<a id="FNanchor_2536_2536" href="#Footnote_2536_2536" class="fnanchor">2536</a> So also among the Khasias,<a id="FNanchor_2537_2537" href="#Footnote_2537_2537" class="fnanchor">2537</a> Chalikata
Mishmis,<a id="FNanchor_2538_2538" href="#Footnote_2538_2538" class="fnanchor">2538</a> Aino,<a id="FNanchor_2539_2539" href="#Footnote_2539_2539" class="fnanchor">2539</a> Negroes of Bondo,<a id="FNanchor_2540_2540" href="#Footnote_2540_2540" class="fnanchor">2540</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>Marriage ceremonies arose by degrees and in various ways.
When the mode of contracting a marriage altered, the earlier
mode, from having been a reality, survived as a ceremony.
Thus, as we have seen, the custom of capture was transformed
into a mere symbol, after purchase was introduced as
the legal form of contracting a marriage. In other instances
the custom of purchase has survived as a ceremony, after it
has ceased to be a reality.</p>

<p>According as marriage was recognized as a matter of some
importance, the entering into it came, like many other significant
events in human life, to be celebrated with certain
ceremonies. Very commonly it is accompanied by a wedding
feast. Among the Nufi people, for example, the nuptials
consist of the payment of the bride-price followed by eating
and drinking.<a id="FNanchor_2541_2541" href="#Footnote_2541_2541" class="fnanchor">2541</a> Among the Wanyoro, the wedding is celebrated
by a great deal of feasting, and the bride is taken by a procession
of friends to her new lord.<a id="FNanchor_2542_2542" href="#Footnote_2542_2542" class="fnanchor">2542</a> Often the feast continues
for several days, a week, or even longer.<a id="FNanchor_2543_2543" href="#Footnote_2543_2543" class="fnanchor">2543</a> In Mykonos, of the
Cyclades, according to Mr. Bent, ten or fifteen days of festivity
usually accompany a marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2544_2544" href="#Footnote_2544_2544" class="fnanchor">2544</a> Among some peoples, the
expenses are defrayed by the bridegroom,<a id="FNanchor_2545_2545" href="#Footnote_2545_2545" class="fnanchor">2545</a> in others by the
father of the bride.<a id="FNanchor_2546_2546" href="#Footnote_2546_2546" class="fnanchor">2546</a> Probably, in the former cases, the feast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
is considered almost a part of the purchase sum, whilst in the
latter it is, perhaps, occasionally regarded as a compensation
for the bride-price.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony often indicates in some way the
new relation into which the man and woman enter to each
other. Sometimes it symbolizes sexual intercourse,<a id="FNanchor_2547_2547" href="#Footnote_2547_2547" class="fnanchor">2547</a> but far
more frequently the living together, or the wife’s subjection to
her husband. Among the Navajos, the ceremony merely
consisted in eating maize pudding from the same platter;<a id="FNanchor_2548_2548" href="#Footnote_2548_2548" class="fnanchor">2548</a>
and among the Santals, says Colonel Dalton, “the social meal
that the boy and girl eat together is the most important part of
the ceremony, as by the act the girl ceases to belong to her
father’s tribe, and becomes a member of her husband’s family.”<a id="FNanchor_2549_2549" href="#Footnote_2549_2549" class="fnanchor">2549</a>
Eating together is, in the Malay Archipelago, the chief and most
wide-spread marriage ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_2550_2550" href="#Footnote_2550_2550" class="fnanchor">2550</a> The same custom occurs
among the Hovas, Hindus, Esthonians, in Ermland in Prussia,
and in Sardinia.<a id="FNanchor_2551_2551" href="#Footnote_2551_2551" class="fnanchor">2551</a> Again in some Brazilian tribes, marriage is
contracted by the husband and wife drinking brandy together.<a id="FNanchor_2552_2552" href="#Footnote_2552_2552" class="fnanchor">2552</a></p>

<p>In Japan, where the ceremony seems to be regarded as
the least important part of the whole proceeding, it consists
in the drinking by both parties, after a prescribed fashion, of
a fixed number of cups of wine.<a id="FNanchor_2553_2553" href="#Footnote_2553_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a> In Scandinavia, the couple
used to drink the contents of a single beaker—a custom
which also occurs in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_2554_2554" href="#Footnote_2554_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a> The joining of hands, or the
bridegroom’s taking the bride by the hand, is, as Dr. Winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>nitz
remarks, one of the most important marriage ceremonies
among all Indo-European peoples.<a id="FNanchor_2555_2555" href="#Footnote_2555_2555" class="fnanchor">2555</a> The same custom occurs
among the Orang-Banûwa of Malacca;<a id="FNanchor_2556_2556" href="#Footnote_2556_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a> whilst, among the
Orang-Sakai, “the little finger of the right hand of the man
is joined to that of the left hand of the woman.”<a id="FNanchor_2557_2557" href="#Footnote_2557_2557" class="fnanchor">2557</a> At Khasia
weddings, “the couple about to be married merely sit together
in one seat, and receive their friends, to whom they give a
dinner or feast.”<a id="FNanchor_2558_2558" href="#Footnote_2558_2558" class="fnanchor">2558</a> Among the Veddahs of Ceylon, the bride
ties a thin cord of her own twisting round the bridegroom’s
waist, and they are then husband and wife. This string is
emblematic of the marriage tie, and, “as he never parts with
it, so he clings to his wife through life.”<a id="FNanchor_2559_2559" href="#Footnote_2559_2559" class="fnanchor">2559</a> The Hindu bride
and bridegroom, again, have their hands bound together with
grass.<a id="FNanchor_2560_2560" href="#Footnote_2560_2560" class="fnanchor">2560</a> Among the Gonds and Korkús, the actual marriage
ceremonies consist, in part, of “eating together, tying the
garments together, dancing together round a pole, being half
drowned together by a douche of water, and the interchange
of rings,—all of which may be supposed to symbolize the
union of the parties.”<a id="FNanchor_2561_2561" href="#Footnote_2561_2561" class="fnanchor">2561</a> In many parts of India, bride and
bridegroom are, for the same reason, marked with one
another’s blood,<a id="FNanchor_2562_2562" href="#Footnote_2562_2562" class="fnanchor">2562</a> and Colonel Dalton believes this to be the
origin of the custom, now so common, of marking with red-lead.
Thus, the Parkheyas use a red powder called “sindúr,” the
bridegroom sealing the compact by touching and marking
with it the forehead of his bride.<a id="FNanchor_2563_2563" href="#Footnote_2563_2563" class="fnanchor">2563</a></p>

<p>Among the Australian Narrinyeri, on the other hand, a
woman is supposed to signify her consent to the marriage by
carrying fire to her husband’s hut, and making his fire for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
him.<a id="FNanchor_2564_2564" href="#Footnote_2564_2564" class="fnanchor">2564</a> The Negroes of Loango contract their marriages by
the bridegroom’s eating from two dishes, which the bride has
cooked for him in his own hut.<a id="FNanchor_2565_2565" href="#Footnote_2565_2565" class="fnanchor">2565</a> In Dahomey, according to
Mr. Forbes, there is no ceremony in marriage, except where
the king confers the wife, “in which instance the maiden
presents her future lord with a glass of rum.”<a id="FNanchor_2566_2566" href="#Footnote_2566_2566" class="fnanchor">2566</a> In Croatia,
the bridegroom boxes the bride’s ears in order to indicate
that henceforth he is her master.<a id="FNanchor_2567_2567" href="#Footnote_2567_2567" class="fnanchor">2567</a> And in ancient Russia,
as part of the marriage ceremony, the father took a new whip,
and after striking his daughter gently with it, told her that
he did so for the last time, and then presented the whip to
the bridegroom.<a id="FNanchor_2568_2568" href="#Footnote_2568_2568" class="fnanchor">2568</a></p>

<p>Many of the ceremonies observed at our own weddings
belong to the classes here noticed. The “best man” seems
originally to have been the chief abettor of the bridegroom in
the act of capture; the nuptials are generally celebrated with
a feast in the house of the bride’s father, and the wedding-ring
is a symbol of the close union which exists between
husband and wife.<a id="FNanchor_2569_2569" href="#Footnote_2569_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a> Even the religious part of the ceremony
has its counterpart among many Pagan nations.</p>

<p>It was natural that a religious character should be given
to nuptials, as well as to other events of importance,
by the invoking of divine help for the future union. In
Hudson’s Island, says Turner, “hardly anything could be
done without first making it known to the gods and begging
a blessing, protection, or whatever the case might require.”<a id="FNanchor_2570_2570" href="#Footnote_2570_2570" class="fnanchor">2570</a>
Among the Dyaks, one of the eldest male members of the
assembled party smears at the wedding the hands of the
bridegroom and bride with the blood of a pig and a fowl,
implores the protection of the male spirit, Baak, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
female spirit, Hiroeh Bakak, and recommends the married
couple to their care, wishing them all sorts of earthly blessings.<a id="FNanchor_2571_2571" href="#Footnote_2571_2571" class="fnanchor">2571</a>
Among the Gonds, sacrifice to the gods, and unlimited
gorging and spirit drinking are usually the wind-up of the
wedding.<a id="FNanchor_2572_2572" href="#Footnote_2572_2572" class="fnanchor">2572</a> In Patagonia, the husband, after having brought
the bride into his hut, makes a sacrifice to the foul spirit;
and the Macatecas, a tribe subject to the Mexican empire
“fasted, prayed, and sacrificed to their gods for the space of
twenty days after their marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_2573_2573" href="#Footnote_2573_2573" class="fnanchor">2573</a></p>

<p>Most commonly a priest is called to perform the religious
rite. “The marriages of the Fijians,” Wilkes says, “are
sanctioned by religious ceremonies.... The Ambati, or
priest, takes a seat, having the bridegroom on his right and
the bride on the left hand. He then invokes the protection
of the god or spirit upon the bride, after which he leads her
to the bridegroom, and joins their hands with injunctions to
love, honour, and obey, to be faithful and die with each
other.”<a id="FNanchor_2574_2574" href="#Footnote_2574_2574" class="fnanchor">2574</a> This, however, happens principally among the
chiefs; among the common people, the marriage rites are
less ceremonious, the priest of the tribe only coming to the
house and invoking happiness upon the union.<a id="FNanchor_2575_2575" href="#Footnote_2575_2575" class="fnanchor">2575</a> The Tahitians,
too, considered the sanction of the gods essential to the
marriage contract. The preliminaries being adjusted, the
parties repaired to the temple, where the priest addressed
the bridegroom usually in the following terms:—“Will you
not cast away your wife?” to which the bridegroom
answered, “No.” Turning to the bride, he proposed to her a
like question, and received a similar answer. The priest
then addressed them both, saying, “Happy will it be if thus
with you two.” He then offered a prayer to the gods on
their behalf, imploring that they might live in affection, and
realize the happiness marriage was designed to secure.<a id="FNanchor_2576_2576" href="#Footnote_2576_2576" class="fnanchor">2576</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
the Kingsmill Islands, the priest presses the foreheads of the
young couple together, and pours on their heads a little
cocoa-nut oil; then he takes a branch of a tree, dips it in
water, and sprinkles their faces, at the same time praying
for their future happiness and prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_2577_2577" href="#Footnote_2577_2577" class="fnanchor">2577</a> Among the Kukis,
the young couple are led before the Thémpoo, or priest,
“who presents them with a stoup of liquor out of which
they both drink, while he continues muttering some words
in his unknown language;”<a id="FNanchor_2578_2578" href="#Footnote_2578_2578" class="fnanchor">2578</a> and, among the Khyoungtha<a id="FNanchor_2579_2579" href="#Footnote_2579_2579" class="fnanchor">2579</a>
and Garos,<a id="FNanchor_2580_2580" href="#Footnote_2580_2580" class="fnanchor">2580</a> a priest beseeches the gods to bless the union.
Among the Igorrotes of Luzon it is a priestess that performs
the marriage ceremony, praying to the spirits of the deceased
in the presence of all the kinsfolk of the couple.<a id="FNanchor_2581_2581" href="#Footnote_2581_2581" class="fnanchor">2581</a> The
Jakuts require the shaman’s assistance for their nuptials,<a id="FNanchor_2582_2582" href="#Footnote_2582_2582" class="fnanchor">2582</a>
and so did formerly the Kalmucks.<a id="FNanchor_2583_2583" href="#Footnote_2583_2583" class="fnanchor">2583</a></p>

<p>The religious ceremonies connected with marriage are not
limited to prayers, sacrifices, and other means of pleasing the
gods; efforts are also made to ascertain their will beforehand.
In Siam, the parents of the parties solicit the opinion of some
fortune-teller on the point whether the year, month, and day
of the week when the couple were born, will allow of their
living happily together as husband and wife.<a id="FNanchor_2584_2584" href="#Footnote_2584_2584" class="fnanchor">2584</a> Among the
Chukmas, “omens are carefully observed, and many a promising
match has been put a stop to by unfavourable
auguries.”<a id="FNanchor_2585_2585" href="#Footnote_2585_2585" class="fnanchor">2585</a> The same is the case with other peoples of
India,<a id="FNanchor_2586_2586" href="#Footnote_2586_2586" class="fnanchor">2586</a> the Mongols,<a id="FNanchor_2587_2587" href="#Footnote_2587_2587" class="fnanchor">2587</a> some Turkish nations,<a id="FNanchor_2588_2588" href="#Footnote_2588_2588" class="fnanchor">2588</a> &amp;c. In several
countries it is considered a thing of the utmost importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
to find out the right day for the wedding, by consulting the
stars or otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_2589_2589" href="#Footnote_2589_2589" class="fnanchor">2589</a></p>

<p>Among civilized nations marriage is almost universally
contracted with religious ceremonies either with or without
the assistance of a priest. The ancient Mexicans were married
by their priests,<a id="FNanchor_2590_2590" href="#Footnote_2590_2590" class="fnanchor">2590</a> and so were the Chibchas<a id="FNanchor_2591_2591" href="#Footnote_2591_2591" class="fnanchor">2591</a> and Mayas.<a id="FNanchor_2592_2592" href="#Footnote_2592_2592" class="fnanchor">2592</a>
In Nicaragua, the priest, in performing the ceremony of
marriage, took the parties by the little finger, and led them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
to a fire which was kindled for the occasion. He instructed
them in their duty, and, when the fire became extinguished,
the parties were looked upon as husband and wife.<a id="FNanchor_2593_2593" href="#Footnote_2593_2593" class="fnanchor">2593</a></p>

<p>By Buddhist monks marriage is regarded only as a
concession to human frailty, and, in Buddhistic countries, it
is therefore a simple civil contract;<a id="FNanchor_2594_2594" href="#Footnote_2594_2594" class="fnanchor">2594</a> nevertheless, it is commonly
contracted with some religious ceremony, and often
with the assistance of a lama.<a id="FNanchor_2595_2595" href="#Footnote_2595_2595" class="fnanchor">2595</a> In China, the bridal pair are
conducted to the ancestral hall, where they prostrate themselves
before the altar, on which the ancestral tablets are
arranged.<a id="FNanchor_2596_2596" href="#Footnote_2596_2596" class="fnanchor">2596</a> Among the Hebrews, marriage was no religious
contract, and there is no trace of a priestly consecration of it
either in the Scriptures or in the Talmud. Yet, according to
Ewald, it may be taken for granted that a consecration took
place on the day of betrothal or wedding, though the particulars
have not been preserved in any ancient description.<a id="FNanchor_2597_2597" href="#Footnote_2597_2597" class="fnanchor">2597</a>
Among the Mohammedans also, marriage, though a mere civil
contract, is concluded with a prayer to Allah.<a id="FNanchor_2598_2598" href="#Footnote_2598_2598" class="fnanchor">2598</a></p>

<p>“Les lois des peuples de l’antiquité,” M. Glasson says,
“avaient un caractère à la fois religieux et civil; il n’est donc
pas étonnant qu’elles aient le plus souvent fait du mariage un
acte à la fois religieux et civil.”<a id="FNanchor_2599_2599" href="#Footnote_2599_2599" class="fnanchor">2599</a> In Egypt, at least during
the Ptolemaic period, the wedding is supposed to have been
accompanied by a religious ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_2600_2600" href="#Footnote_2600_2600" class="fnanchor">2600</a> Among the ancient
Persians, the betrothal was performed by a priest, who joined
the hands of the couple whilst reading some prayers.<a id="FNanchor_2601_2601" href="#Footnote_2601_2601" class="fnanchor">2601</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
Hindus used by prayers and sacrifices to invoke the help of the
gods at their weddings.<a id="FNanchor_2602_2602" href="#Footnote_2602_2602" class="fnanchor">2602</a> According to Sir W. H. Macnaghten,
marriage is among them “not merely a civil contract, but
a sacrament, forming the last of the ceremonies prescribed to
the three regenerate classes, and the only one for Śudras;
and an unmarried man has been declared to be incapacitated
from the performance of religious duties.”<a id="FNanchor_2603_2603" href="#Footnote_2603_2603" class="fnanchor">2603</a> In Greece, marriages
were generally, though not always, contracted at the
divine altars and confirmed by oaths, the assistance of a priest,
however, not being requisite. Before the marriage was
solemnized, the gods were consulted and their assistance
implored by prayers and sacrifices, which were usually offered
to some of the deities that superintended the union of the sexes,
by the parents or other relations of the persons to be married.
For marriage, as Musonius says, “stands under the protection
of great and powerful gods;” and Plato teaches us that a
man shall cohabit only with a woman who has come into his
house with holy ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_2604_2604" href="#Footnote_2604_2604" class="fnanchor">2604</a> From the Homeric age we
have no instances of marriages being contracted with
sacrifices and religious rites, but we must not therefore
take for granted that they were entirely wanting.<a id="FNanchor_2605_2605" href="#Footnote_2605_2605" class="fnanchor">2605</a> The
Teutons, according to Weinhold, looked upon marriage as an
important and holy undertaking, about which it was necessary
that the gods should be consulted; and offerings were probably
in use among all peoples of this branch of the Aryan
race.<a id="FNanchor_2606_2606" href="#Footnote_2606_2606" class="fnanchor">2606</a> The Romans, at their nuptials, made a sacrifice, named
<i>libum farreum</i>, to the gods, and the couple were united with
prayer.<a id="FNanchor_2607_2607" href="#Footnote_2607_2607" class="fnanchor">2607</a> In the mode of marriage called <i>confarreatio</i>, the
Pontifex Maximus seems to have instructed them in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
formulas, and some modern authorities even believe that he
performed the marriage ceremony. But Rossbach thinks that
this was scarcely the case in early times, when every house-father
himself was a priest.<a id="FNanchor_2608_2608" href="#Footnote_2608_2608" class="fnanchor">2608</a> Besides sacrifices and prayers,
auspices formed a very important part of a Roman wedding;
and, if the gods were found to be opposed to the match, the
nuptials were put off or the match was abandoned. Even
Cicero considered it wicked to marry without auspices.<a id="FNanchor_2609_2609" href="#Footnote_2609_2609" class="fnanchor">2609</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that, among primitive Aryans, religious
ceremonies were requisite for the validity of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2610_2610" href="#Footnote_2610_2610" class="fnanchor">2610</a>
This was certainly not the case in historical times either
among the Greeks or among the Teutons; and at Rome
such ceremonies were obligatory only in <i>confarreatio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2611_2611" href="#Footnote_2611_2611" class="fnanchor">2611</a> But
this form of marriage peculiar to the patricians, derived its
origin from a very early period, and Rossbach remarks that
the farther back we go in antiquity, the more strictly we find
the religious ceremonies attended to.<a id="FNanchor_2612_2612" href="#Footnote_2612_2612" class="fnanchor">2612</a> In <i>confarreatio</i> they
were essential even in the eye of the law, whilst in <i>coemptio</i> and
<i>usus</i> sacrifices and auspices were merely of secondary importance.<a id="FNanchor_2613_2613" href="#Footnote_2613_2613" class="fnanchor">2613</a>
Later on, when indifference to the old faith increased,
they became more and more uncommon, till at the end of
the period of the Pagan Emperors, they were almost exceptional,
being regarded as a matter of no significance.<a id="FNanchor_2614_2614" href="#Footnote_2614_2614" class="fnanchor">2614</a></p>

<p>Christianity gave back to marriage its religious character.
The founder of the Christian Church had not prescribed any
ceremonies in connection with it, but in the earliest times the
Christians, of their own accord, asked for their pastors’ benediction.
This was not, indeed, a necessity, and for widows
sacerdotal nuptials were not even allowed.<a id="FNanchor_2615_2615" href="#Footnote_2615_2615" class="fnanchor">2615</a> Yet from St.
Paul’s words, “Τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο μέγα ἐστίν”<a id="FNanchor_2616_2616" href="#Footnote_2616_2616" class="fnanchor">2616</a>—in the Vulgate
translated, “Sacramentum hoc magnum est,”—the dogma
that marriage is a sacrament was gradually developed.
Though this dogma was fully recognized in the twelfth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
century,<a id="FNanchor_2617_2617" href="#Footnote_2617_2617" class="fnanchor">2617</a> marriage was, nevertheless, considered valid without
ecclesiastical benediction till the year 1563, when the Council
of Trent made it an essentially religious ceremony.</p>

<p>Luther’s opinion that all matrimonial affairs belong not to
the Church, but to the jurists, was not accepted by the
legislators of the Protestant countries. Marriage certainly
ceased to be thought of as a sacrament, but continued to be
regarded by the Protestants as a Divine institution; hence
sacerdotal nuptials remained as indispensable as ever.</p>

<p>It was the French Revolution that first gave rise to an
alteration in this respect. The constitution of the 3rd September,
1791, declares in its seventh article, title ii., “La loi ne
considère le mariage que comme contrat civil. Le pouvoir
législatif établira pour tous les habitants, sans distinction, le
mode par lequel les naissances, mariages et décès seront constatés
et il désignera les officiers publics qui en recevront les
actes.”<a id="FNanchor_2618_2618" href="#Footnote_2618_2618" class="fnanchor">2618</a> To this obligatory civil act a sacerdotal benediction
may be added, if the parties think proper.</p>

<p>Since then civil marriage has gradually obtained a footing
in the legislation of most European countries, in proportion
as liberty of conscience has been recognized. The French
system has lately been adopted in Germany and Switzerland;
whilst other nations have been less radical. “Tantôt,” says
M. Glasson, “on a le choix entre le mariage civil ou le
mariage religieux, en ce sens que l’union bénie à l’église
vaut en même temps, d’après la loi, comme mariage civil:
c’est ce qui a lieu en Angleterre et en Espagne. Tantôt le
mariage religieux est une condition de la validité du mariage
civil, comme en Roumanie. En Italie, on peut indifféremment
célébrer l’une ou l’autre des deux unions la première. Enfin,
il y a des pays où le mariage civil joue un rôle purement
secondaire: en Autriche, en Portugal, en Suède, en Norwége,
il est subsidiaire; en Russie il n’a été établi que pour les
sectaires.”<a id="FNanchor_2619_2619" href="#Footnote_2619_2619" class="fnanchor">2619</a></p>

<p>Civil marriage, implying the necessity of the union being
sanctioned by secular authority, is not a merely European
institution. Among the ancient Peruvians, the king con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>voked
annually, or every two years, at Cuzco all the marriageable
young men and maidens of his family. After calling them
by name, he joined their hands, and delivered them to their
parents. Such marriages among that class were alone denominated
lawful; and the governors and chiefs were, by their
offices, obliged to marry, after the same formalities, the young
men and women of the provinces over which they presided.<a id="FNanchor_2620_2620" href="#Footnote_2620_2620" class="fnanchor">2620</a>
In Nicaragua also, marriage was “a civil rite, performed by
the cacique.”<a id="FNanchor_2621_2621" href="#Footnote_2621_2621" class="fnanchor">2621</a> And among the savage Pomo of California,
who have two chiefs, a “war-chief” and a “peace-chief,” the
latter, as being a kind of <i>censor morum</i>, has to perform the
marriage ceremonies, so far as they extend, <i>i.e.</i>, he causes the
parties to enter into a simple covenant in presence of their
parents and friends.<a id="FNanchor_2622_2622" href="#Footnote_2622_2622" class="fnanchor">2622</a> Again, among certain tribes no
marriage is permitted without the chief’s approval. But such
cases seem to be exceptions among non-European peoples,
especially those of a lower culture, marriage being generally
considered a private matter, with which the authorities or the
community have nothing to do, if only it takes place between
persons who, by law or custom, are permitted to intermarry.</p>

<p>In this chapter reference has often been made to the validity
of marriage. A lawful marriage is, indeed, quite a
different thing from a marriage in the natural history sense of
the term. The former, which is contracted under the formalities
and in accordance with the stipulations prescribed by the
written or unwritten laws of the country, implies the recognition
by society both of the validity of the union and the
legitimacy of the children. Every people is not so happy as
the Nukahivans, among whom, according to Lisiansky, no
such thing as illegitimacy is known.<a id="FNanchor_2623_2623" href="#Footnote_2623_2623" class="fnanchor">2623</a> The Greeks regarded a
union into which the woman entered without dowry as concubinage,
rather than as marriage. Among other peoples purchase
is the only way of contracting a valid marriage. So it was with
the ancient Germans and Scandinavians.<a id="FNanchor_2624_2624" href="#Footnote_2624_2624" class="fnanchor">2624</a> So it is with the
Californian Karok, among whom the children of a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
who is not purchased are accounted no better than bastards
and constitute a class of social outcasts who can intermarry
only among themselves.<a id="FNanchor_2625_2625" href="#Footnote_2625_2625" class="fnanchor">2625</a> Often certain ceremonies are
required for a marriage to be legal. Thus the Romans considered
an alliance made without <i>sponsalia</i>, <i>nuptiæ</i>, and <i>dos</i>,
concubinage.<a id="FNanchor_2626_2626" href="#Footnote_2626_2626" class="fnanchor">2626</a> Among the Nez Percés in Oregon, the consent
of the parents is all that is necessary for a marriage to be
valid; sometimes, when the parents refuse their consent, a
run-away match occurs, “but it is not regarded as a legal
marriage, and the woman thereafter is considered a prostitute,
and is treated accordingly.”<a id="FNanchor_2627_2627" href="#Footnote_2627_2627" class="fnanchor">2627</a></p>

<small>THE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</small></h2>


<p>Most of the lower animal species are by instinct either
monogamous or polygynous. With man, every possible form
of marriage occurs. There are marriages of one man with
one woman (monogamy), of one man with many women
(polygyny), of many men with one woman (polyandry), and,
in a few exceptional cases, of many men with many women.</p>

<p>Polygyny was permitted by most of the ancient peoples
with whom history acquaints us, and is, in our day, permitted
by several civilized nations and the bulk of savage tribes.</p>

<p>The ancient Chibchas practised polygyny to a large extent.<a id="FNanchor_2628_2628" href="#Footnote_2628_2628" class="fnanchor">2628</a>
Among the Mexicans<a id="FNanchor_2629_2629" href="#Footnote_2629_2629" class="fnanchor">2629</a> and the Peruvian Incas,<a id="FNanchor_2630_2630" href="#Footnote_2630_2630" class="fnanchor">2630</a> a married
man might have, besides his legitimate wife, less legitimate
wives or concubines. The same is the case in China and
Japan, where the children of a concubine have the same legal
rights as the children of a wife.<a id="FNanchor_2631_2631" href="#Footnote_2631_2631" class="fnanchor">2631</a> In Corea, the mandarins
are even bound by custom, besides having several wives, to
retain several concubines in their “yamen.”<a id="FNanchor_2632_2632" href="#Footnote_2632_2632" class="fnanchor">2632</a></p>

<p>Tradition shows polygyny and concubinage to have been
customary among the Hebrews during the patriarchal age.
Esau married Judith and Basemath, Jacob married Leah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
and Rachel.<a id="FNanchor_2633_2633" href="#Footnote_2633_2633" class="fnanchor">2633</a> Later on, we read of Solomon, who had “seven
hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines;”<a id="FNanchor_2634_2634" href="#Footnote_2634_2634" class="fnanchor">2634</a>
and of Rehoboam, who “took eighteen wives and threescore
concubines.”<a id="FNanchor_2635_2635" href="#Footnote_2635_2635" class="fnanchor">2635</a> Indeed, polygyny was so much a matter of
course that the law did not even criticize it.<a id="FNanchor_2636_2636" href="#Footnote_2636_2636" class="fnanchor">2636</a> According
to the Talmudic right also, it was permitted, though the
number of legitimate wives was restricted to four.<a id="FNanchor_2637_2637" href="#Footnote_2637_2637" class="fnanchor">2637</a> Among
European Jews, it was still practised during the Middle
Ages, and, among Jews living in Mohammedan countries, it
occurs even to this day.<a id="FNanchor_2638_2638" href="#Footnote_2638_2638" class="fnanchor">2638</a> The Korân allows a man to take
four legitimate wives,<a id="FNanchor_2639_2639" href="#Footnote_2639_2639" class="fnanchor">2639</a> and he may take as many concubines
as he likes. Between a wife and a concubine the difference
is, indeed, not great: the former has her father as her protector,
whilst the latter is defenceless against the husband.<a id="FNanchor_2640_2640" href="#Footnote_2640_2640" class="fnanchor">2640</a> A slave,
on the other hand, is not permitted to have more than two
wives at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_2641_2641" href="#Footnote_2641_2641" class="fnanchor">2641</a></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus informs us that the Egyptians were not
restricted to any number of wives, but that everyone married
as many as he chose, with the exception of the priesthood,
who were by law confined to one consort.<a id="FNanchor_2642_2642" href="#Footnote_2642_2642" class="fnanchor">2642</a> The Egyptians
had concubines also, most of whom appear to have been foreign
women—war-captives or slaves; and these were members of
the family, ranking next to the wives and children of their
lord, and probably enjoying a share of the property after his
death.<a id="FNanchor_2643_2643" href="#Footnote_2643_2643" class="fnanchor">2643</a> With regard to the Assyrians, Professor Rawlinson
states that, so far as we have any real evidence, their kings
appear as monogamists; but he thinks it is probable that
they had a certain number of concubines.<a id="FNanchor_2644_2644" href="#Footnote_2644_2644" class="fnanchor">2644</a> In Media, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
other hand, polygyny was commonly practised among the
more wealthy classes;<a id="FNanchor_2645_2645" href="#Footnote_2645_2645" class="fnanchor">2645</a> and the Persian kings, particularly in
later times, had a considerable number of wives and
concubines.<a id="FNanchor_2646_2646" href="#Footnote_2646_2646" class="fnanchor">2646</a></p>

<p>None of the Hindu law-books restricts the number
of wives whom a man is permitted to marry.<a id="FNanchor_2647_2647" href="#Footnote_2647_2647" class="fnanchor">2647</a> We find undoubted
cases of polygyny in the hymns of the ‘Rig-Veda,’<a id="FNanchor_2648_2648" href="#Footnote_2648_2648" class="fnanchor">2648</a>
and several passages in the ‘Laws of Manu’ provide for
a plurality of wives without any restriction.<a id="FNanchor_2649_2649" href="#Footnote_2649_2649" class="fnanchor">2649</a> Speaking of
the modern Hindus, Mr. Balfour says, “By the law a Hindu
may marry as many wives, and by custom keep as many
concubines, as he may choose.”<a id="FNanchor_2650_2650" href="#Footnote_2650_2650" class="fnanchor">2650</a></p>

<p>The Greeks of the Homeric age frequently had concubines,
who lived in the same house as the man’s family, and were
regarded half as wives.<a id="FNanchor_2651_2651" href="#Footnote_2651_2651" class="fnanchor">2651</a> Polygyny, in the fullest sense of
the term, appears to be ascribed to Priam, but to no one else.<a id="FNanchor_2652_2652" href="#Footnote_2652_2652" class="fnanchor">2652</a>
At a later period a kind of concubinage seems to have been
recognized in Greece by law, and scarcely proscribed by
public opinion;<a id="FNanchor_2653_2653" href="#Footnote_2653_2653" class="fnanchor">2653</a> and bigamy was practised by the tyrants in
some of the Greek colonies.<a id="FNanchor_2654_2654" href="#Footnote_2654_2654" class="fnanchor">2654</a> The Romans were more
strictly monogamous. Among them, concubinage was always
well distinguished from legal marriage, and, according to
Rossbach, was much less common in early times than
subsequently.<a id="FNanchor_2655_2655" href="#Footnote_2655_2655" class="fnanchor">2655</a></p>

<p>Among the Teutons, at the beginning of their history, we
come across plurality of wives in the West,<a id="FNanchor_2656_2656" href="#Footnote_2656_2656" class="fnanchor">2656</a> and especially in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
the North. The Scandinavian kings indulged in polygyny,<a id="FNanchor_2657_2657" href="#Footnote_2657_2657" class="fnanchor">2657</a>
and it does not seem to have been restricted to them only.<a id="FNanchor_2658_2658" href="#Footnote_2658_2658" class="fnanchor">2658</a>
Nor was it unknown to the pagan Russians.<a id="FNanchor_2659_2659" href="#Footnote_2659_2659" class="fnanchor">2659</a> In the Finnish
poems, though polygyny is not mentioned, there are passages
which seem to indicate that it was not entirely unheard of
among the Finns of early times.<a id="FNanchor_2660_2660" href="#Footnote_2660_2660" class="fnanchor">2660</a></p>

<p>Even in the Christian world open polygyny has occasionally
been permitted, or at least tolerated. It was frequently
practised by the Merovingian kings, and one law of Charles
the Great seems to imply that it was not unknown even
among priests.<a id="FNanchor_2661_2661" href="#Footnote_2661_2661" class="fnanchor">2661</a> Soon after the Peace of Westphalia, bigamy
was allowed in some German States where the population had
been largely reduced during the Thirty Years’ War. And in
modern Europe polygyny, as Mr. Spencer remarks, long
survived in the custom which permitted princes to have many
mistresses; “polygyny in this qualified form remaining a
tolerated privilege of royalty down to late times.”<a id="FNanchor_2662_2662" href="#Footnote_2662_2662" class="fnanchor">2662</a> Moreover,
St. Augustin said expressly that he did not condemn
polygyny;<a id="FNanchor_2663_2663" href="#Footnote_2663_2663" class="fnanchor">2663</a> and Luther allowed Philip the Magnanimous of
Hessen, for political reasons, to marry two women. Indeed,
he openly declared that, as Christ is silent about polygyny, he
could not forbid the taking of more than one wife.<a id="FNanchor_2664_2664" href="#Footnote_2664_2664" class="fnanchor">2664</a> The
Mormons, as all the world knows, regard polygyny as a
divine institution.</p>

<p>Among many savage peoples polygyny is developed to an
extraordinary extent. In Unyoro, according to Emin Pasha,
it would be absolutely improper for even a small chief to have
fewer than ten or fifteen wives, and poor men have three or four
each.<a id="FNanchor_2665_2665" href="#Footnote_2665_2665" class="fnanchor">2665</a> Serpa Pinto tells us of a minister in the Barôze, who at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
the time of his visit to that country had more than seventy
wives.<a id="FNanchor_2666_2666" href="#Footnote_2666_2666" class="fnanchor">2666</a> In Fiji, the chiefs had from twenty to a hundred
wives;<a id="FNanchor_2667_2667" href="#Footnote_2667_2667" class="fnanchor">2667</a> and, among all of the North American tribes visited
by Mr. Catlin, “it is no uncommon thing to find a chief with
six, eight, or ten, and some with twelve or fourteen wives in
his lodge.”<a id="FNanchor_2668_2668" href="#Footnote_2668_2668" class="fnanchor">2668</a> The King of Loango is said to have seven
thousand wives.<a id="FNanchor_2669_2669" href="#Footnote_2669_2669" class="fnanchor">2669</a></p>

<p>It is a more noteworthy fact that among not a few
uncivilized peoples, polygyny is almost unknown, or even
prohibited. The Wyandots, according to Heriot, restricted
themselves to one wife;<a id="FNanchor_2670_2670" href="#Footnote_2670_2670" class="fnanchor">2670</a> and, among the Iroquois, polygyny
was not permitted, nor did it ever become a practice.<a id="FNanchor_2671_2671" href="#Footnote_2671_2671" class="fnanchor">2671</a> It is
said that, among the Californian Kinkla and Yurok, no man has
more than one wife.<a id="FNanchor_2672_2672" href="#Footnote_2672_2672" class="fnanchor">2672</a> The Karok do not allow bigamy even
to the chief; and, though a man may own as many women
for slaves as he can purchase, he brings obloquy upon himself
if he cohabits with more than one.<a id="FNanchor_2673_2673" href="#Footnote_2673_2673" class="fnanchor">2673</a> Nor does polygyny
occur among the Simas, the Coco-Maricopas, and several other
tribes on the banks of the Gila and the Colorado;<a id="FNanchor_2674_2674" href="#Footnote_2674_2674" class="fnanchor">2674</a> nor among
the Moquis in New Mexico, and certain nations who inhabit
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.<a id="FNanchor_2675_2675" href="#Footnote_2675_2675" class="fnanchor">2675</a> And, in several tribes of
South America, the men are stated to have but one wife.<a id="FNanchor_2676_2676" href="#Footnote_2676_2676" class="fnanchor">2676</a></p>

<p>The Guanches of the Canary Islands, except the inhabitants
of Lancerote, lived in monogamy;<a id="FNanchor_2677_2677" href="#Footnote_2677_2677" class="fnanchor">2677</a> and the same is the case
with the Quissama tribe in Angola, the Touaregs, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
Beni-Mzab.<a id="FNanchor_2678_2678" href="#Footnote_2678_2678" class="fnanchor">2678</a> Among all the Moorish tribes in the Western
Sahara, Vincent did not meet a single man who had a
plurality of wives.<a id="FNanchor_2679_2679" href="#Footnote_2679_2679" class="fnanchor">2679</a></p>

<p>In Asia we find many instances of strictly monogamous
peoples. The Veddahs in Ceylon are so rigorous in this respect
that infidelity never seems to occur among them.<a id="FNanchor_2680_2680" href="#Footnote_2680_2680" class="fnanchor">2680</a>
In the Andaman Islands, according to Mr. E. H. Man, “bigamy,
polygamy, polyandry, and divorce are unknown;”<a id="FNanchor_2681_2681" href="#Footnote_2681_2681" class="fnanchor">2681</a> and the
Nicobar Islanders—at least those on the most northern island,
Car Nicobar—“have but one wife, and look upon unchastity
as a very deadly sin.”<a id="FNanchor_2682_2682" href="#Footnote_2682_2682" class="fnanchor">2682</a> Among the Koch and Old Kukis,
polygyny and concubinage are forbidden;<a id="FNanchor_2683_2683" href="#Footnote_2683_2683" class="fnanchor">2683</a> whilst, among the
Pádams, Mikris, and Munda Kols, a man, though not expressly
forbidden to have many wives, is blamed if he has more than
one.<a id="FNanchor_2684_2684" href="#Footnote_2684_2684" class="fnanchor">2684</a> The Badagas of the Neilgherry Hills, the Nagas of
Upper Assam, the Kisáns, and Meches confine themselves to
one consort at the same time;<a id="FNanchor_2685_2685" href="#Footnote_2685_2685" class="fnanchor">2685</a> and so do the Mrús and
Toungtha, who do not consider it right for a master to take
advantage of his position even with regard to the female
slaves in his house.<a id="FNanchor_2686_2686" href="#Footnote_2686_2686" class="fnanchor">2686</a> Among the Santals, says Mr. E. G. Man,
a woman reigns alone in her husband’s wigwam, “as there is
seldom, if ever, a second wife or concubine to divide his affections—polygamy,
although not exactly prohibited, being not
very popular with the tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_2687_2687" href="#Footnote_2687_2687" class="fnanchor">2687</a> Among the Karens of Burma,<a id="FNanchor_2688_2688" href="#Footnote_2688_2688" class="fnanchor">2688</a>
and certain tribes of Indo-China, the Malay Peninsula, and
the Indian Archipelago, polygyny is said either to be forbidden<a id="FNanchor_2689_2689" href="#Footnote_2689_2689" class="fnanchor">2689</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
or unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2690_2690" href="#Footnote_2690_2690" class="fnanchor">2690</a> The Igorrotes of Luzon are so strictly monogamous,
that, in case of adultery, the guilty party can be compelled
to leave the hut and the family for ever.<a id="FNanchor_2691_2691" href="#Footnote_2691_2691" class="fnanchor">2691</a> The Hill
Dyaks marry but one wife, and a chief who once broke
through this custom lost all his influence; adultery is entirely
unknown among them.<a id="FNanchor_2692_2692" href="#Footnote_2692_2692" class="fnanchor">2692</a> The Alfura of Minahassa were
formerly monogamists, and the occasional occurrence of
polygyny in later times, according to Dr. Hickson, was a
degeneration from the old customs, brought about perhaps
by Mohammedan influence.<a id="FNanchor_2693_2693" href="#Footnote_2693_2693" class="fnanchor">2693</a></p>

<p>In Santa Christina or Tauata (Marquesas Islands), monogamy
is said to be the exclusive form of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_2694_2694" href="#Footnote_2694_2694" class="fnanchor">2694</a> Among
the Papuans of Dorey, not only is polygyny forbidden, but
concubinage and adultery are unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2695_2695" href="#Footnote_2695_2695" class="fnanchor">2695</a> In Australia, Mr.
Curr has discovered some truly monogamous tribes. In the
Eucla tribe, “none of the men have more than one wife;”<a id="FNanchor_2696_2696" href="#Footnote_2696_2696" class="fnanchor">2696</a>
among the Karawalla and Tunberri tribes, dwelling on the
Lower Diamantina, polygyny is not allowed;<a id="FNanchor_2697_2697" href="#Footnote_2697_2697" class="fnanchor">2697</a> and in the
Birria tribe, “the possession of more than one wife is
absolutely forbidden, or was so before the coming of the
whites.”<a id="FNanchor_2698_2698" href="#Footnote_2698_2698" class="fnanchor">2698</a></p>

<p>In certain American tribes the chiefs alone are permitted
to have a plurality of wives.<a id="FNanchor_2699_2699" href="#Footnote_2699_2699" class="fnanchor">2699</a> A similar exclusive privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
seems to have been granted to the nobility in ancient Peru.<a id="FNanchor_2700_2700" href="#Footnote_2700_2700" class="fnanchor">2700</a>
Among the Ainos of Yessy, according to v. Siebold only the
chief of the village, and, in some places, the wealthier men are
allowed to have more than one wife.<a id="FNanchor_2701_2701" href="#Footnote_2701_2701" class="fnanchor">2701</a></p>

<p>Even where polygyny is permitted by custom or law, it is
by no means so generally practised as is often supposed.
Almost everywhere it is confined to the smaller part of the
people, the vast majority being monogamous. We are told
that, in the New Hebrides, “all the men are polygamists,
generally having three or four wives apiece;”<a id="FNanchor_2702_2702" href="#Footnote_2702_2702" class="fnanchor">2702</a> that among
certain Kafir tribes, “the average number of wives to each
married man amongst the common people is about three;”<a id="FNanchor_2703_2703" href="#Footnote_2703_2703" class="fnanchor">2703</a>
that, among the Masai, a poor man has generally two wives.<a id="FNanchor_2704_2704" href="#Footnote_2704_2704" class="fnanchor">2704</a>
But there is sufficient evidence that such peoples form exceptions
to an almost universal rule.</p>

<p>In a ‘Sociological Study’ on the Lower Congo, Mr.
Phillips remarks, “It is a mistaken opinion that in a polygamous
society most men have more than one wife: the relative
numbers of the sexes forbid the arrangement being
extended to the whole population; really only the wealthier
can indulge in a plurality of wives, the poorer having to be
content with one or often with none.”<a id="FNanchor_2705_2705" href="#Footnote_2705_2705" class="fnanchor">2705</a> Proyart says the
same of the people of Loango, adding that the rich, who can
use the privilege of having many wives, are far from being
numerous;<a id="FNanchor_2706_2706" href="#Footnote_2706_2706" class="fnanchor">2706</a> and like statements are made with reference to
several other negro peoples.<a id="FNanchor_2707_2707" href="#Footnote_2707_2707" class="fnanchor">2707</a> Among many Kafir tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2708_2708" href="#Footnote_2708_2708" class="fnanchor">2708</a> the
Bechuanas,<a id="FNanchor_2709_2709" href="#Footnote_2709_2709" class="fnanchor">2709</a> Hottentots,<a id="FNanchor_2710_2710" href="#Footnote_2710_2710" class="fnanchor">2710</a> and Eastern Central Africans,<a id="FNanchor_2711_2711" href="#Footnote_2711_2711" class="fnanchor">2711</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
monogamy is the rule; whilst, amongst the Touaregs,<a id="FNanchor_2712_2712" href="#Footnote_2712_2712" class="fnanchor">2712</a> Tedâ,<a id="FNanchor_2713_2713" href="#Footnote_2713_2713" class="fnanchor">2713</a>
Marea,<a id="FNanchor_2714_2714" href="#Footnote_2714_2714" class="fnanchor">2714</a> Beni-Amer,<a id="FNanchor_2715_2715" href="#Footnote_2715_2715" class="fnanchor">2715</a> &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_2716_2716" href="#Footnote_2716_2716" class="fnanchor">2716</a> polygyny is expressly stated to be
confined to a few men only. “La plupart des Kabyles,”
say Messrs. Honateau and Letournex, “n’ont ... qu’une
femme;”<a id="FNanchor_2717_2717" href="#Footnote_2717_2717" class="fnanchor">2717</a> and in Egypt, according to Mr. Lane, not more
than one husband in twenty has two wives.<a id="FNanchor_2718_2718" href="#Footnote_2718_2718" class="fnanchor">2718</a> We may, indeed,
say with Munzinger<a id="FNanchor_2719_2719" href="#Footnote_2719_2719" class="fnanchor">2719</a> that even in Africa, the chief centre
of polygynous habits, polygyny is an exception.</p>

<p>It is so among all Mohammedan peoples, in Asia and
Europe, as well as in Africa.<a id="FNanchor_2720_2720" href="#Footnote_2720_2720" class="fnanchor">2720</a> “In India,” says Syed Amír’
Alí, “more than ninety-five per cent. of Mohammedans are at
the present moment, either by conviction or necessity, monogamists.
Among the educated classes versed in the history
of their ancestors, and able to compare it with the records of
other nations, the custom is regarded with disapprobation
amounting almost to disgust. In Persia, according to Colonel
Macgregor’s statement, only two per cent. of the population
enjoy the questionable luxury of a plurality of wives.<a id="FNanchor_2721_2721" href="#Footnote_2721_2721" class="fnanchor">2721</a> Moreover,
although polygyny is sanctioned by custom among the
Cochin Chinese, the Siamese, the Hindus, and many other races
of India, the mass of these peoples are in practice monogamous.<a id="FNanchor_2722_2722" href="#Footnote_2722_2722" class="fnanchor">2722</a>
In China, among the labouring classes, it is rare to find more
than one woman to one man, and Dr. Gray thinks that, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
the earliest ages, concubinage was a privilege of the wealthy
classes only.<a id="FNanchor_2723_2723" href="#Footnote_2723_2723" class="fnanchor">2723</a> Among the peoples of Central and Northern
Asia and, generally, among all the uncivilized or semi-civilized
peoples belonging to the Russian Empire, polygyny is, or,
before the introduction of Christianity, was, an exception.<a id="FNanchor_2724_2724" href="#Footnote_2724_2724" class="fnanchor">2724</a></p>

<p>In the Indian Archipelago, says Mr. Crawfurd, polygyny
and concubinage exist only among a few of the higher ranks,
and may be looked upon as a kind of vicious luxury of the
great, for it would be absurd to regard either one or the other
as an institution affecting the whole mass of society.<a id="FNanchor_2725_2725" href="#Footnote_2725_2725" class="fnanchor">2725</a> The
truth of this assertion is fully confirmed by Raffles, as regards
the Javanese; by Low and Boyle, as regards the Malays of
Sarawak; by Marsden, Wilken, and Forbes as regards
the Sumatrans; by Schadenberg, as regards the Aëtas of the
Philippines; and so on.<a id="FNanchor_2726_2726" href="#Footnote_2726_2726" class="fnanchor">2726</a></p>

<p>In various parts of the Australian continent monogamy is
said to be the rule.<a id="FNanchor_2727_2727" href="#Footnote_2727_2727" class="fnanchor">2727</a> In the Larrakía tribe (Port Darwin),
for instance, only about ten per cent. of those who are
married have two wives.<a id="FNanchor_2728_2728" href="#Footnote_2728_2728" class="fnanchor">2728</a> In Tasmania, polygyny, if not
unknown, was quite exceptional.<a id="FNanchor_2729_2729" href="#Footnote_2729_2729" class="fnanchor">2729</a> Among the Maoris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
according to Dieffenbach, it is “very uncommon.”<a id="FNanchor_2730_2730" href="#Footnote_2730_2730" class="fnanchor">2730</a> In the
Sandwich Islands, it was practised only by the chiefs, whose
means enabled them to maintain a plurality of wives.<a id="FNanchor_2731_2731" href="#Footnote_2731_2731" class="fnanchor">2731</a>
Indeed, in almost every group of the Pacific Islands polygyny
is expressly stated to be an exception.<a id="FNanchor_2732_2732" href="#Footnote_2732_2732" class="fnanchor">2732</a></p>

<p>The same is the case with the American aborigines.<a id="FNanchor_2733_2733" href="#Footnote_2733_2733" class="fnanchor">2733</a>
Dalager states that, on the west coast of Greenland, in his
time, hardly one man in twenty had two wives, and it was
still more uncommon for one man to have three or four.<a id="FNanchor_2734_2734" href="#Footnote_2734_2734" class="fnanchor">2734</a>
Among the Thlinkets, as a rule, a man had but one wife.<a id="FNanchor_2735_2735" href="#Footnote_2735_2735" class="fnanchor">2735</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
The aborigines of Hispaniola, with the exception of the
king or chief, seemed to Columbus to live in monogamy.<a id="FNanchor_2736_2736" href="#Footnote_2736_2736" class="fnanchor">2736</a>
And Mr. Bridges writes that, in Tierra del Fuego, polygyny
is practised “in some districts very rarely, in others more
frequently, but in no part generally.”</p>

<p>All the statements we have from the ancient world seem
to indicate that polygyny was an exception. Speaking of
the Hebrews, Dr. Scheppig says that, although our information
about the marital affairs of common Hebrews is too
scanty to entitle us to conclude, from the scarcity of cases of
polygyny recorded, that such cases were actually rare, we
may assume that keeping up several establishments was too
expensive for any but the rich.<a id="FNanchor_2737_2737" href="#Footnote_2737_2737" class="fnanchor">2737</a> In Egypt, as we may infer
from the numerous ancient paintings illustrative of domestic
life in that country, polygyny was of rare occurrence; and
Herodotus expressly affirms that it was customary for the
Egyptians to marry only one wife.”<a id="FNanchor_2738_2738" href="#Footnote_2738_2738" class="fnanchor">2738</a> Spiegel thinks that the
ancient Persians were as a rule monogamous,<a id="FNanchor_2739_2739" href="#Footnote_2739_2739" class="fnanchor">2739</a> and Sir Henry
Maine and Dr. Schrader make a similar suggestion as to the
early Indo-Europeans in general.<a id="FNanchor_2740_2740" href="#Footnote_2740_2740" class="fnanchor">2740</a> Among the West Germans,
according to Tacitus, only a few persons of noble birth had
a plurality of wives;<a id="FNanchor_2741_2741" href="#Footnote_2741_2741" class="fnanchor">2741</a> and, in India, polygyny as a rule was
confined to kings and wealthy lords.<a id="FNanchor_2742_2742" href="#Footnote_2742_2742" class="fnanchor">2742</a> In a hymn of the
‘Rig-Veda,’ which dwells upon the duality of the two Aświns,
the pairs of deities are compared with pairs of almost
everything that runs in couples, including a husband and
wife, and two lips uttering sweet sounds.<a id="FNanchor_2743_2743" href="#Footnote_2743_2743" class="fnanchor">2743</a></p>

<p>Where polygyny occurs, it is modified, as a rule, in ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
that tend towards monogamy: first, through the higher
position granted to one of the wives, generally the first
married; secondly, through the preference given by the
husband to his favourite wife as regards sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>Among the Greenlanders,<a id="FNanchor_2744_2744" href="#Footnote_2744_2744" class="fnanchor">2744</a> Thlinkets,<a id="FNanchor_2745_2745" href="#Footnote_2745_2745" class="fnanchor">2745</a> Kaniagmuts,<a id="FNanchor_2746_2746" href="#Footnote_2746_2746" class="fnanchor">2746</a> Crees,<a id="FNanchor_2747_2747" href="#Footnote_2747_2747" class="fnanchor">2747</a>
and probably most of the North American tribes who
practise polygyny,<a id="FNanchor_2748_2748" href="#Footnote_2748_2748" class="fnanchor">2748</a> the first married wife is the mistress of
the house. The Aleuts distinguish the first or real wife from
the subsequent wives by a special name.<a id="FNanchor_2749_2749" href="#Footnote_2749_2749" class="fnanchor">2749</a> Among the Ahts,
the children of a chief’s extra wives have not the father’s
rank.<a id="FNanchor_2750_2750" href="#Footnote_2750_2750" class="fnanchor">2750</a> The Algonquins, says Heriot, permit two wives to
one husband, but “the one is considered of a rank superior to
the other, and her children alone are accounted legitimate.”<a id="FNanchor_2751_2751" href="#Footnote_2751_2751" class="fnanchor">2751</a>
Among the Mexicans,<a id="FNanchor_2752_2752" href="#Footnote_2752_2752" class="fnanchor">2752</a> Mayas,<a id="FNanchor_2753_2753" href="#Footnote_2753_2753" class="fnanchor">2753</a> Chibchas,<a id="FNanchor_2754_2754" href="#Footnote_2754_2754" class="fnanchor">2754</a> and Peruvians,<a id="FNanchor_2755_2755" href="#Footnote_2755_2755" class="fnanchor">2755</a> the
first wife took precedence of the subsequent wives, or, strictly
speaking, they had only one “true and lawful wife,” though
as many concubines as they liked. In Nicaragua, bigamy, in
the juridical sense of the term, was punished by exile and
confiscation of property;<a id="FNanchor_2756_2756" href="#Footnote_2756_2756" class="fnanchor">2756</a> and, in Mexico, neither the wives
of “second rank” nor their children could inherit property.<a id="FNanchor_2757_2757" href="#Footnote_2757_2757" class="fnanchor">2757</a>
Among the Mosquitoes, Tamanacs, Uaupés, Mundrucûs,<a id="FNanchor_2758_2758" href="#Footnote_2758_2758" class="fnanchor">2758</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
other South American peoples,<a id="FNanchor_2759_2759" href="#Footnote_2759_2759" class="fnanchor">2759</a> the first wife generally has
superiority in domestic affairs. Among the Brazilian aborigines,
however, no difference in rights exist between the
children of different wives.<a id="FNanchor_2760_2760" href="#Footnote_2760_2760" class="fnanchor">2760</a></p>

<p>The first wife is superior in authority to the others among
the Western Victorians, Narrinyeri, Maoris,<a id="FNanchor_2761_2761" href="#Footnote_2761_2761" class="fnanchor">2761</a> &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_2762_2762" href="#Footnote_2762_2762" class="fnanchor">2762</a> In Samoa,
a chief had, besides his wife, one, two, or three concubines;<a id="FNanchor_2763_2763" href="#Footnote_2763_2763" class="fnanchor">2763</a>
and in Tahiti, according to Ellis, it was rather a system of
concubinage than a plurality of wives, that prevailed among
the higher chiefs, the woman to whom the chief was first
united in marriage, or whose rank was nearest his own, being
generally considered his wife in the proper sense of the term,
while the others held an inferior position.<a id="FNanchor_2764_2764" href="#Footnote_2764_2764" class="fnanchor">2764</a></p>

<p>In the Indian Archipelago, according to Mr. Crawfurd,
the wife of the first marriage is always the real mistress of
the family; the rest are often little better than her hand-maids.<a id="FNanchor_2765_2765" href="#Footnote_2765_2765" class="fnanchor">2765</a>
The same holds good for the Burmese, according
to Lieutenant-General Fytche; for the Santals, according to
Colonel Dalton.<a id="FNanchor_2766_2766" href="#Footnote_2766_2766" class="fnanchor">2766</a> In Siam, “the wife who has been the object
of the marriage ceremony ‘khan mak’ takes precedence of all
the rest, and she and her descendants are the only legal heirs
to the husband’s possessions.”<a id="FNanchor_2767_2767" href="#Footnote_2767_2767" class="fnanchor">2767</a> Among the Khamtis,
Samoyedes,<a id="FNanchor_2768_2768" href="#Footnote_2768_2768" class="fnanchor">2768</a> and other Asiatic peoples,<a id="FNanchor_2769_2769" href="#Footnote_2769_2769" class="fnanchor">2769</a> the first wife is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
always the mistress of the household and the most respected
in the family; whilst, among the Ainos,<a id="FNanchor_2770_2770" href="#Footnote_2770_2770" class="fnanchor">2770</a> Mongols, and Tangutans,<a id="FNanchor_2771_2771" href="#Footnote_2771_2771" class="fnanchor">2771</a>
one man can take only one lawful wife, though as many
concubines as he pleases. But, except among the Ainos, the
children of concubines are illegitimate and have no share in
the inheritance.</p>

<p>The polygyny of China is a legalized concubinage, and the
law actually prohibits the taking of a second wife during the
lifetime of the first.<a id="FNanchor_2772_2772" href="#Footnote_2772_2772" class="fnanchor">2772</a> The wife is invested with a certain
amount of power over the concubines, who may not even sit
in her presence without special permission.<a id="FNanchor_2773_2773" href="#Footnote_2773_2773" class="fnanchor">2773</a> She addresses
her partner with a term corresponding to our “husband,”
whilst the concubines call him “master.”<a id="FNanchor_2774_2774" href="#Footnote_2774_2774" class="fnanchor">2774</a> These are generally
women with large feet and of low origin, not unfrequently
slaves or prostitutes; whereas the wife is almost invariably,
except of course in the case of Tartar ladies, a woman with
small feet.<a id="FNanchor_2775_2775" href="#Footnote_2775_2775" class="fnanchor">2775</a> A wife cannot be degraded to the position of a
concubine, nor can a concubine be raised to the position of a
wife so long as the wife is alive, under a penalty in the one
case of a hundred, in the other of ninety blows.<a id="FNanchor_2776_2776" href="#Footnote_2776_2776" class="fnanchor">2776</a> But the
question upon which the legitimacy of the offspring depends,
is not whether the woman is wife or concubine, but whether
she has been received into the house of the man or not.<a id="FNanchor_2777_2777" href="#Footnote_2777_2777" class="fnanchor">2777</a>
In Mohammedan countries, in households where two or
more wives belong to one man, the first married generally
enjoys the highest rank; she is called “the great lady,” and is
commonly united with her husband for life. But all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
children of the man are considered equally legitimate, even
those born of female slaves.<a id="FNanchor_2778_2778" href="#Footnote_2778_2778" class="fnanchor">2778</a></p>

<p>Among the negro peoples, the principal wife, to whom the
housekeeping and command over all the rest are intrusted,
is in most cases the one first married. She has certain
privileges, and in many cases can be repudiated only if she
has been unfaithful to her husband.<a id="FNanchor_2779_2779" href="#Footnote_2779_2779" class="fnanchor">2779</a> Among the Edeeyahs
of Fernando Po, it was for the first wife alone that a man had
to serve several years with his father-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_2780_2780" href="#Footnote_2780_2780" class="fnanchor">2780</a> Speaking of
the Eastern Central African tribes, Mr. Macdonald says, “As
a rule, a man has one wife that is free, while the other three
or four are slaves.... The chief wife is generally the woman
that was married first.... The chief wife has the superintendence
of the domestic and agricultural establishment.
She keeps the others at their work, and has power to exercise
discipline upon them.” Generally, it is only by inheriting the
possessions of an elder brother that a man procures more
than one free wife.<a id="FNanchor_2781_2781" href="#Footnote_2781_2781" class="fnanchor">2781</a> Among the Damaras and other South
African tribes, the eldest son of the principal or first wife
inherits his father’s property.<a id="FNanchor_2782_2782" href="#Footnote_2782_2782" class="fnanchor">2782</a> Speaking of the Basutos, Mr.
Casalis observes, “A very marked distinction exists between
the first wife and those who succeed her. The choice of the
‘great’ wife (as she is always called) is generally made by
the father, and is an event in which all the relations are
interested. The others, who are designated by the name of
‘serete’ (heels), because they must on all occasions hold an
inferior position to the mistress of the house, are articles of
luxury, to which the parents are not obliged to contribute.”
The chief of the Basutos, when asked by foreigners how many
children he has, alludes in his answer only to those of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
first wife; and, if he says he is a widower, this means that he
has lost his real wife, and has not raised any of his concubines
to the rank she occupied.<a id="FNanchor_2783_2783" href="#Footnote_2783_2783" class="fnanchor">2783</a> Among the Zulus, the chief wife
is the one first married,<a id="FNanchor_2784_2784" href="#Footnote_2784_2784" class="fnanchor">2784</a> and this is often, but not always,
the case among the Kafirs.<a id="FNanchor_2785_2785" href="#Footnote_2785_2785" class="fnanchor">2785</a> According to Rochon, polygyny
in Madagascar is, in fact, a sort of concubinage.<a id="FNanchor_2786_2786" href="#Footnote_2786_2786" class="fnanchor">2786</a></p>

<p>Eber suggests that the kings of ancient Egypt, although
they might have many concubines, had only one real wife, as
there is no instance of two consorts given in the inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_2787_2787" href="#Footnote_2787_2787" class="fnanchor">2787</a>
Professor Rawlinson makes a similar remark as to the polygyny
of the Persian kings.<a id="FNanchor_2788_2788" href="#Footnote_2788_2788" class="fnanchor">2788</a> Regarding the Hindus, Mr.
Mayne says, “A peculiar sanctity ... seems to have been
attributed to the first marriage, as being that which was contracted
from a sense of duty, and not merely for personal
gratification. The first married wife had precedence over the
others, and her first-born son over his half-brothers. It is
probable that originally the secondary wives were considered
as merely a superior class of concubines, like the hand-maids
of the Jewish patriarchs.”<a id="FNanchor_2789_2789" href="#Footnote_2789_2789" class="fnanchor">2789</a> It was necessary that the first
married wife should be of the same caste as her husband.<a id="FNanchor_2790_2790" href="#Footnote_2790_2790" class="fnanchor">2790</a> She
sat by him at marriages and other religious ceremonies, was
head of the family, and entitled to adopt a son if she had no
sons at the time of her husband’s death.<a id="FNanchor_2791_2791" href="#Footnote_2791_2791" class="fnanchor">2791</a> The modified
polygyny of the ancient Assyrians and Greeks has been
already noted. The ancient Scandinavians had almost
always only one legitimate wife, though as many concubines
as they chose.<a id="FNanchor_2792_2792" href="#Footnote_2792_2792" class="fnanchor">2792</a> Touching the Pagan Russians, Ewers says
that of the wives of a prince one probably had precedence.<a id="FNanchor_2793_2793" href="#Footnote_2793_2793" class="fnanchor">2793</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
Among the Mormons, Sir R. F. Burton observes, “the first
wife, as among polygamists generally, is <i>the</i> wife and assumes
the husband’s name and title.”<a id="FNanchor_2794_2794" href="#Footnote_2794_2794" class="fnanchor">2794</a></p>

<p>The difference in the position held by the several wives
belonging to one man, shows itself also in the demand of
various peoples that the first wife shall be of the husband’s
rank, whilst the succeeding wives may be of lower birth.<a id="FNanchor_2795_2795" href="#Footnote_2795_2795" class="fnanchor">2795</a></p>

<p>As just mentioned, there is another way in which polygyny
is modified. Among certain peoples the husband is bound
by custom or law to cohabit with his wives in turn. The
Caribs, when they married several sisters at the same time,
lived a month with each in her separate hut.<a id="FNanchor_2796_2796" href="#Footnote_2796_2796" class="fnanchor">2796</a> Among the
wild Indians of Chili, according to Mr. Darwin, the cazique
lives a week in turn with each of his wives.<a id="FNanchor_2797_2797" href="#Footnote_2797_2797" class="fnanchor">2797</a> The Kafirs
have an old traditional law requiring a husband who has
many wives to devote three succeeding days and nights to
each of them.<a id="FNanchor_2798_2798" href="#Footnote_2798_2798" class="fnanchor">2798</a> A Mohammedan is obliged to visit his four
legal wives by turns;<a id="FNanchor_2799_2799" href="#Footnote_2799_2799" class="fnanchor">2799</a> and the same custom prevails, according
to Krasheninnikoff, in Kamchatka.<a id="FNanchor_2800_2800" href="#Footnote_2800_2800" class="fnanchor">2800</a> The negroes often
follow a like rule in order to keep peace in the family.<a id="FNanchor_2801_2801" href="#Footnote_2801_2801" class="fnanchor">2801</a> And,
in Samoa, the system adopted when a person has several
wives, “is to allow each wife to enjoy three days’ supremacy
in rotation.”<a id="FNanchor_2802_2802" href="#Footnote_2802_2802" class="fnanchor">2802</a> But such arrangements are, no doubt, exceptions,
and it is doubtful whether, in these cases, theory and
practice coincide.<a id="FNanchor_2803_2803" href="#Footnote_2803_2803" class="fnanchor">2803</a> A marriage may, in fact, be monogamous,
though, from a juridical point of view, it is polygynous.</p>

<p>“It is not uncommon for an Indian,” says Carver,
“although he takes to himself so many wives, to live in a
state of continence with many of them for several years,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
those who do not succeed in pleasing the husband may “continue
in their virgin state during the whole of their lives.”<a id="FNanchor_2804_2804" href="#Footnote_2804_2804" class="fnanchor">2804</a>
Among the Apaches, the chiefs “can have any number of
wives they choose, but one only is the favourite.”<a id="FNanchor_2805_2805" href="#Footnote_2805_2805" class="fnanchor">2805</a> In Bokhara,
a rich man generally has two, three, or four wives; yet,
according to Georgi, one of them, as a rule, holds precedence
in the husband’s love.<a id="FNanchor_2806_2806" href="#Footnote_2806_2806" class="fnanchor">2806</a> Speaking of the modern Egyptians,
Mr. Lane says, “In general, the most beautiful of a man’s
wives or slaves is, of course, for a time his greatest favourite;
but in many—if not most—cases, the lasting favourite is not
the most handsome.”<a id="FNanchor_2807_2807" href="#Footnote_2807_2807" class="fnanchor">2807</a> Sometimes the wife who has proved
most fruitful and given birth to the healthiest children is
most favoured by the husband;<a id="FNanchor_2808_2808" href="#Footnote_2808_2808" class="fnanchor">2808</a> and, among the Indians
of Western Washington and North-Western Oregon, according
to Dr. Gibbs, the man usually lives with his first wife, at
least after his interest in subsequent wives has cooled down.<a id="FNanchor_2809_2809" href="#Footnote_2809_2809" class="fnanchor">2809</a>
But it is generally the youngest wife who is the favourite.
An Arabian Sheik said to Sir S. W. Baker, “I have four
wives; as one has become old, I have replaced her with a
young one; here they all are (he now marked four strokes
upon the sand with his stick). This one carries water; that

much, as she is the youngest, and my favourite.”<a id="FNanchor_2810_2810" href="#Footnote_2810_2810" class="fnanchor">2810</a> In Guiana,
“an Indian is never seen with two young wives; the only
case in which he takes a second is when the first has become
old.” The first wife certainly retains the management of
domestic affairs, but she no longer possesses the husband’s
love.<a id="FNanchor_2811_2811" href="#Footnote_2811_2811" class="fnanchor">2811</a> Statements to a similar effect are made regarding
the Arabs of the Sahara, Tahitians, Central Asiatic Turks,

<p>Bigamy is the most common form of polygyny, and a
multitude of wives is the luxury of a few despotic rulers or
very wealthy men. The Eskimo, for example, have rarely
more than two wives, and a Greenlander who took a third or
fourth was blamed by his countrymen, as we are told by
Cranz.<a id="FNanchor_2813_2813" href="#Footnote_2813_2813" class="fnanchor">2813</a> The tribes of Oregon generally confine themselves

<p>Polyandry is a much rarer form of marriage than polygyny.
In Oonalashka, one of the Aleutian Islands, according to
v. Langsdorf, a woman sometimes lived with two husbands
who agreed between themselves upon the conditions on which
they were to share her.<a id="FNanchor_2819_2819" href="#Footnote_2819_2819" class="fnanchor">2819</a> Among the Kaniagmuts, two or
three men occasionally had a wife in common;<a id="FNanchor_2820_2820" href="#Footnote_2820_2820" class="fnanchor">2820</a> and Veniaminoff
tells us that in ancient times a Thlinket woman, besides
her real husband, could have a legal paramour, who usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
was the brother of the husband.<a id="FNanchor_2821_2821" href="#Footnote_2821_2821" class="fnanchor">2821</a> Among the Eskimo also,
“two men sometimes marry the same woman.”<a id="FNanchor_2822_2822" href="#Footnote_2822_2822" class="fnanchor">2822</a> Father
Lafitau writes, “Par une suite de la Gynécocratie, la polygamie,
qui n’est pas permise aux hommes, l’est pourtant aux
femmes chez les Iroquois Tsonnontouans, où il en est,
lesquelles ont deux maris, qu’on regarde comme légitimes.”<a id="FNanchor_2823_2823" href="#Footnote_2823_2823" class="fnanchor">2823</a>
Among the Avanos and Maypurs, along the Orinoco,
v. Humboldt found that brothers often had but one wife;<a id="FNanchor_2824_2824" href="#Footnote_2824_2824" class="fnanchor">2824</a>
according to Mr. Brett, the Warraus do not consider the
practice of one woman having two husbands to be bad; and
he mentions an instance of a woman amongst them having
even three.<a id="FNanchor_2825_2825" href="#Footnote_2825_2825" class="fnanchor">2825</a></p>

<p>In Nukahiva, as we are told by Lisiansky, in rich families
every woman had two husbands, of whom one might be called
the assistant husband.<a id="FNanchor_2826_2826" href="#Footnote_2826_2826" class="fnanchor">2826</a> In New Caledonia, according to M.
Moncelon, polyandry does not seem to have been entirely
unknown;<a id="FNanchor_2827_2827" href="#Footnote_2827_2827" class="fnanchor">2827</a> and Mr. Radfield writes to me from Lifu that an
old man knew of three cases of polyandrous marriage having
occurred in that island, but the husbands were despised by
the rest of the natives. In two of these cases the husbands
were brothers, in the third they were unrelated. It is said
that, among the Tasmanians, “polyandry, or something very
like it, existed;”<a id="FNanchor_2828_2828" href="#Footnote_2828_2828" class="fnanchor">2828</a> but this statement, if correct, refers to
altogether exceptional cases.</p>

<p>Bontier and Le Verrier assert that, in the island of Lancerote,
of the Canaries, most women had three husbands.<a id="FNanchor_2829_2829" href="#Footnote_2829_2829" class="fnanchor">2829</a>

women who married two men.<a id="FNanchor_2830_2830" href="#Footnote_2830_2830" class="fnanchor">2830</a> Dr. Fritsch mentions the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>

among the mountain tribes of the Bantu race.<a id="FNanchor_2831_2831" href="#Footnote_2831_2831" class="fnanchor">2831</a> The Hovas

prolonged absence from home.<a id="FNanchor_2832_2832" href="#Footnote_2832_2832" class="fnanchor">2832</a></p>

<p>Until prohibited by the governor, Sir Henry Ward, about
the year 1860, polyandry prevailed among the Sinhalese
throughout the interior of Ceylon, one woman having in many
cases three or four husbands, and in others five or six or even
seven. It is recorded that the same practice was at one time
universal throughout the island, except among the Veddahs,<a id="FNanchor_2833_2833" href="#Footnote_2833_2833" class="fnanchor">2833</a>
and even now it occurs in spite of government interdict.<a id="FNanchor_2834_2834" href="#Footnote_2834_2834" class="fnanchor">2834</a>
The husbands are usually members of the same family, and
most frequently brothers.</p>

<p>Among the Todas, all brothers of one family, be they many
or few, live in mixed cohabitation with one or more wives.
“If there be four or five brothers,” says Dr. Shortt, “and one
of them, being old enough, gets married, his wife claims all
the other brothers as her husbands, and, as they successively
attain manhood, she consorts with them; or, if the wife has one
or more younger sisters, they in turn, on attaining a marriageable
age, become the wives of their sister’s husband or husbands....
Owing, however, to the great scarcity of women in
this tribe, it more frequently happens that a single woman is
wife to several husbands, sometimes as many as six.”<a id="FNanchor_2835_2835" href="#Footnote_2835_2835" class="fnanchor">2835</a> The
same practice occurs among the Kurgs of Mysore.<a id="FNanchor_2836_2836" href="#Footnote_2836_2836" class="fnanchor">2836</a> Among
the Nairs of Malabar, it is the custom for one woman “to
have attached to her two males, or four, or perhaps more, and
they cohabit according to rules.”<a id="FNanchor_2837_2837" href="#Footnote_2837_2837" class="fnanchor">2837</a> Polyandry is also found
among the Miris, Dophlas, Butlas,<a id="FNanchor_2838_2838" href="#Footnote_2838_2838" class="fnanchor">2838</a> Sissee Abors,<a id="FNanchor_2839_2839" href="#Footnote_2839_2839" class="fnanchor">2839</a> Khasias,<a id="FNanchor_2840_2840" href="#Footnote_2840_2840" class="fnanchor">2840</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
and Santals.<a id="FNanchor_2841_2841" href="#Footnote_2841_2841" class="fnanchor">2841</a> It prevails in the Siwalik mountains, Sirmore,<a id="FNanchor_2842_2842" href="#Footnote_2842_2842" class="fnanchor">2842</a>
Ladakh,<a id="FNanchor_2843_2843" href="#Footnote_2843_2843" class="fnanchor">2843</a> the Jounsar and Bawar hill districts attached to the
Doon,<a id="FNanchor_2844_2844" href="#Footnote_2844_2844" class="fnanchor">2844</a> Kunawar,<a id="FNanchor_2845_2845" href="#Footnote_2845_2845" class="fnanchor">2845</a> Kotegarh,<a id="FNanchor_2846_2846" href="#Footnote_2846_2846" class="fnanchor">2846</a> and, especially, in Tibet. This
custom exists, as Mr. Wilson asserts, “all over the country of
the Tibetan-speaking people; that is to say, from China to
the dependencies of Kashmir and Afghanistan, with the exception
of Sikkim, and some other of the provinces on the
Indian side of the Himalaya, where, though the Tibetan
language may in part prevail, yet the people are either Aryan
in race, or have been much influenced by Aryan ideas.”<a id="FNanchor_2847_2847" href="#Footnote_2847_2847" class="fnanchor">2847</a>
Polyandry is said to occur among the Saporogian Cossacks;<a id="FNanchor_2848_2848" href="#Footnote_2848_2848" class="fnanchor">2848</a>
and Mr. Ravenstein quotes a statement of a Japanese traveller
that it prevails among the Smerenkur Gilyaks in Eastern
Siberia.<a id="FNanchor_2849_2849" href="#Footnote_2849_2849" class="fnanchor">2849</a></p>

<p>With the exception of the Nairs, Khasias, and Saporogian
Cossacks, the husbands in almost every one of these cases are
stated to be brothers. A colonel who lived among the Kulus
of Kotegarh for twenty-five years assures us that, among that
people, the husbands are always brothers;<a id="FNanchor_2850_2850" href="#Footnote_2850_2850" class="fnanchor">2850</a> and, so far as Mr.
Wilson could learn, the polyandry of Central Asia must be
limited to the marriage of one woman to two or more brothers,
no other form being found there.<a id="FNanchor_2851_2851" href="#Footnote_2851_2851" class="fnanchor">2851</a></p>

<p>A very curious kind of polyandry prevails, according to
Dr. Shortt, among the Reddies. It often happens that a
young woman of sixteen or twenty years of age is married to
a boy of five or six years, or even of a tenderer age. After
marriage the wife lives with some other man, a near relation
on the maternal side, frequently an uncle, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
with her boy-husband’s own father, the progeny so begotten
being affiliated to the boy-husband. When he comes of age
he finds his wife an old woman, and perhaps past child-bearing.
So he, in his turn, takes possession of the wife of
some other boy, who will nominally be the father of her
children.<a id="FNanchor_2852_2852" href="#Footnote_2852_2852" class="fnanchor">2852</a> A similar custom is said to exist among the
Vellalah caste in the Coimbore district,<a id="FNanchor_2853_2853" href="#Footnote_2853_2853" class="fnanchor">2853</a> and prevailed, till
the emancipation of the serfs, among the Russian peasants,
the father being in the habit of cohabiting with the wife of
his son during the son’s minority.<a id="FNanchor_2854_2854" href="#Footnote_2854_2854" class="fnanchor">2854</a> Ahlqvist mentions the
occurrence of the same practice among the Ostyaks,<a id="FNanchor_2855_2855" href="#Footnote_2855_2855" class="fnanchor">2855</a>
v. Haxthausen among the Ossetes.<a id="FNanchor_2856_2856" href="#Footnote_2856_2856" class="fnanchor">2856</a></p>

<p>Passing to ancient nations, we find indications of polyandry
in a hymn in the ‘Rig-Veda,’ which is addressed to the
two Aświns,<a id="FNanchor_2857_2857" href="#Footnote_2857_2857" class="fnanchor">2857</a>, and in the Mahâbhârata, where Draupadi is
represented as won at an archery match by the eldest of the
five Pandava princes, and as then becoming the wife of all.
According to Strabo, polyandry occurred in Media, and in
Arabia Felix, where all male members of the same family
married one woman.<a id="FNanchor_2858_2858" href="#Footnote_2858_2858" class="fnanchor">2858</a> Ma-touan-lin states that, among the
Massagetæ, the brothers had one wife in common, and when
a man had no brothers he associated with other men, as
otherwise he was obliged to live single through the whole of
his life.<a id="FNanchor_2859_2859" href="#Footnote_2859_2859" class="fnanchor">2859</a> We have in the Irish Nennius direct evidence of
the existence of polyandry among the Picts,<a id="FNanchor_2860_2860" href="#Footnote_2860_2860" class="fnanchor">2860</a> and of the
ancient Britons Cæsar says that “by tens and by twelves
husbands possessed their wives in common, and especially
brothers with brothers, and parents with children.”<a id="FNanchor_2861_2861" href="#Footnote_2861_2861" class="fnanchor">2861</a> Among
the ancient Scandinavians we possibly find a trace of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
custom in the mythic statement that the goddess Frigg,
during the absence of her husband Odin, was married to his
brothers Vili and Ve.<a id="FNanchor_2862_2862" href="#Footnote_2862_2862" class="fnanchor">2862</a></p>

<p>Among the peoples of America, Africa, and the Pacific
Islands, just referred to, polyandry, in almost every case, is
confined to a very small part of the population; and among
the polyandrous nations of India and Central Asia it is by no
means the exclusive form of marriage. Sir Emerson Tennent
says that, in Ceylon, polyandry prevails chiefly among the
wealthier classes, whilst, according to Dr. Davy, it is “more
or less general among the high and low, the rich and poor,”
other forms of marriage, however, being by no means excluded.<a id="FNanchor_2863_2863" href="#Footnote_2863_2863" class="fnanchor">2863</a>
Among the Todas, “any degree of complication in
perfectly lawful wedded life may be met with, from the sample
of the single man living with the single wife, to that of the group
of relatives married to a group of wives.”<a id="FNanchor_2864_2864" href="#Footnote_2864_2864" class="fnanchor">2864</a> Mr. Balfour says
that “the practice of polyandry does not seem to have
ever prevailed generally amongst the Nairs and many of
the Teeyer of North Malabar, from Kurumbranad to
Mangalore.”<a id="FNanchor_2865_2865" href="#Footnote_2865_2865" class="fnanchor">2865</a> Among the Miris there are only a few
instances of this custom.<a id="FNanchor_2866_2866" href="#Footnote_2866_2866" class="fnanchor">2866</a> Of the Dophlas those who can
afford it are polygynists.<a id="FNanchor_2867_2867" href="#Footnote_2867_2867" class="fnanchor">2867</a> Among the Khasias, polyandry
“can be said to prevail only among the poorer sort, with
whom, too, it would often seem to mean rather facility of
divorce than the simultaneous admission of a plurality of
husbands.”<a id="FNanchor_2868_2868" href="#Footnote_2868_2868" class="fnanchor">2868</a> Among the Santals, the wife of the eldest brother
<i>may</i> be at the same time a wife for the younger brothers also.<a id="FNanchor_2869_2869" href="#Footnote_2869_2869" class="fnanchor">2869</a>
The Sissee Abors have often as many wives as they can
afford to buy;<a id="FNanchor_2870_2870" href="#Footnote_2870_2870" class="fnanchor">2870</a> and in the Kunawar valley, polyandry is
common only in the upper part of the valley, whilst polygyny
prevails in the lower part.<a id="FNanchor_2871_2871" href="#Footnote_2871_2871" class="fnanchor">2871</a> In the Kotegarh valley, according
to Dr. Stulpnagel, the practice of polyandry is not universal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
it can scarcely be said to be even very common. “If diligently
searched for,” he observes, “single cases of polyandry will
be found in the Kôtgadh parganâ, in Kulu, in the territory of
the Rânâs of Komarsen and Kaneti, and in Bussahir....
Though common enough in Kunawar at the present day, it
exists side by side with polygamy and monogamy. In one
house there may be three brothers with one wife; in the
next three brothers with four wives, all alike in common; in
the next house there may be a man with three wives to
himself; in the next a man with only one wife.”<a id="FNanchor_2872_2872" href="#Footnote_2872_2872" class="fnanchor">2872</a> Among
the Butias, or Botis, of Ladakh, according to Sir Alexander
Cunningham, polyandry prevails “only among the poorer
classes, for the rich, as in all Eastern countries, generally have
two or three wives, according to their circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_2873_2873" href="#Footnote_2873_2873" class="fnanchor">2873</a> In
the Jounsar and Bawah pargannahs, polyandry is almost
universal, but it is apparently unknown in the hills of Garhwal
on the east, or those of the Simla superintendency on the
west.<a id="FNanchor_2874_2874" href="#Footnote_2874_2874" class="fnanchor">2874</a> Nowhere, except perhaps in the Neilgherry Hills,
has polyandry prevailed more extensively than in Tibet; but
it is not the only form of marriage. According to Captain
J. D. Cunningham, “even among the Lamaic Tibetans any
casual influx of wealth, as from trade or other sources,
immediately leads to the formation of separate establishments
by the several members of a house.”<a id="FNanchor_2875_2875" href="#Footnote_2875_2875" class="fnanchor">2875</a> We may thus take for
granted that polyandry, although frequently practised in
certain parts of India and Central Asia,<a id="FNanchor_2876_2876" href="#Footnote_2876_2876" class="fnanchor">2876</a> nowhere excludes
the simultaneous occurrence of other forms of marriage. The
instances of ancient Aryan polyandry in India evidently
form exceptions to the general rule among the people of the
Vedic period. The father of Draupadi is represented by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
compilers of the epic as shocked at the proposal of the
princes to marry his daughter:—“You who know the law,”
he says, “must not commit an unlawful act which is contrary
to usage and the Vedas.” In the Râmâyana, the giant
Virâdha attacks the two divine brothers Râma and
Lakshmana and their wife Sítâ, saying, “Why do you two
devotees remain with one woman? Why are you, O profligate
wretches, corrupting the devout sages?”<a id="FNanchor_2877_2877" href="#Footnote_2877_2877" class="fnanchor">2877</a> And in the
‘Aitareya Brâhmana’ we read that “one man has many wives,
but one wife has not many husbands at the same time.”<a id="FNanchor_2878_2878" href="#Footnote_2878_2878" class="fnanchor">2878</a>
Indeed, with the exception of the Massagetæ, the account
of whom cannot be critically checked, there is no people among
whom polyandry is stated to be the only recognized form of
marriage.</p>

<p>Like polygyny, polandry is modified in directions tending
towards monogamy. As one, usually the first married, wife
in polygynous families is the chief wife, one, usually the
first, husband in polyandrous families is the chief husband.
This was the case with the Aleuts, among whom, according
to Erman, the secondary husband was generally a hunter
or wandering trader; and with the Kaniagmuts, among
whom, as we have already seen, he acted as husband and
master of the house during the absence of the true lord.
Upon the latter’s return, the deputy not only yielded to him
his place, but became in the meantime his servant.<a id="FNanchor_2879_2879" href="#Footnote_2879_2879" class="fnanchor">2879</a> In
Nukahiva, the subordinate partner sometimes was chosen
after marriage, “but in general,” says Lisiansky, “two men
present themselves to the same woman, who, if she approves
their addresses, appoints one for the real husband, and the
other as his auxiliary; the auxiliary is generally poor, but
handsome and well-made.”<a id="FNanchor_2880_2880" href="#Footnote_2880_2880" class="fnanchor">2880</a></p>

<p>In Ladakh, according to Moorcraft and Trebeck, should
there be several brothers in a family, the juniors, if they agree
to the arrangement, become inferior husbands to the wife of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
the elder; all the children, however, are supposed to belong
to the head of the family. The younger brothers have,
indeed, no authority; they wait upon the elder as his servants,
and can be turned out of doors at his pleasure, without its
being incumbent upon him to provide for them. On the
death of the eldest brother, his property, authority, and widow
devolve upon his next brother.<a id="FNanchor_2881_2881" href="#Footnote_2881_2881" class="fnanchor">2881</a> In Kamaon, too, where the
brothers of a family all marry one wife, the children are attributed
to the eldest brother.<a id="FNanchor_2882_2882" href="#Footnote_2882_2882" class="fnanchor">2882</a> The same is the case in the
Jounsar district, as it was formerly with the Massagetæ.<a id="FNanchor_2883_2883" href="#Footnote_2883_2883" class="fnanchor">2883</a>
Touching the polyandrous tribes of Arabia Felix, Strabo tells
us that the eldest brother was the ruler of the family, and
that the common wife spent the nights with him.<a id="FNanchor_2884_2884" href="#Footnote_2884_2884" class="fnanchor">2884</a> Among
the ancient Britons, as described by Cæsar, the children were
regarded as belonging to him who had first taken the virgin
to wife.<a id="FNanchor_2885_2885" href="#Footnote_2885_2885" class="fnanchor">2885</a> In Tibet, the choice of a wife is the right of the
elder brother, and the contract he makes is understood to involve
a marital contract with all the other brothers, if they
choose to avail themselves of it. The children call the eldest
husband father, the younger husbands uncles.<a id="FNanchor_2886_2886" href="#Footnote_2886_2886" class="fnanchor">2886</a> Among the
Todas also, the eldest brother seems to be the real husband.
“If the husband has brothers or very near relatives, all living
together,” says Mr. Marshall, “they may each, if both she
and he consent, participate in the right to be considered her
husband also, on making up a share of the dowry that has
been paid.”<a id="FNanchor_2887_2887" href="#Footnote_2887_2887" class="fnanchor">2887</a> Again, in Spiti, where polyandry no longer
prevails, the same object is attained by the custom of primogeniture,
by which only the eldest son marries, while the
younger sons become monks.<a id="FNanchor_2888_2888" href="#Footnote_2888_2888" class="fnanchor">2888</a> Speaking of the Khyoungtha,
a Chittagong Hill tribe, Captain Lewin observes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span> “After marriage
a younger brother is allowed to touch the hand, to
speak and laugh with his elder brother’s wife; but it is thought
improper for an elder even to look at the wife of his younger
brother. This is a custom more or less among all hill tribes;
it is found carried to even a preposterous extent among the
Santals.”<a id="FNanchor_2889_2889" href="#Footnote_2889_2889" class="fnanchor">2889</a> In this custom there is perhaps a trace of ancient
polyandry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Summing up the results reached in this chapter, we may
safely say that, although polygyny occurs among most existing
peoples, and polyandry among some, monogamy is by
far the most common form of human marriage. It was so
also among the ancient peoples of whom we have any direct
knowledge. Monogamy is the form which is generally
recognized as legal and permitted. The great majority of
peoples are, as a rule, monogamous, and the other forms of
marriage are usually modified in a monogamous direction.</p>

<p>We have still to inquire how the matter stood in early times,
and to trace the general development of the forms of human
marriage. But, in accordance with our method of investigation,
we must first examine the causes by which these forms
have been influenced.</p>

<small>THE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued</i>)</p>


<p>It has also been asserted that monogamy is the natural
form of human marriage because there is an almost equal
number of men and women. But this is by no means the
case. The numerical proportion between the sexes varies,
and in some cases varies greatly, among different peoples.</p>

<p>In the whole district of Nutka, it seemed to Meares that
there were not so many women as men, whereas, further
north, the women decidedly preponderated.<a id="FNanchor_2890_2890" href="#Footnote_2890_2890" class="fnanchor">2890</a> Among the
Kutchin, according to Kirby, women form the minority;<a id="FNanchor_2891_2891" href="#Footnote_2891_2891" class="fnanchor">2891</a> and
they seem to hold the same position among the Upper Californians
and Western Eskimo.<a id="FNanchor_2892_2892" href="#Footnote_2892_2892" class="fnanchor">2892</a> But as a rule, among the
North American aborigines, the opposite is apparently the
case. Thus there are more women than men among certain
Eskimo tribes, according to Dr. King; among the natives
of the Sitka Islands, according to Lisiansky; among the
Californian Shastika, according to Mr. Powers.<a id="FNanchor_2893_2893" href="#Footnote_2893_2893" class="fnanchor">2893</a> The census
of the Creeks taken in the year 1832 showed
6,555 men and 7,142 women; that of the Indian population
around Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, the Upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
Mississippi, &amp;c., in the same year, 3,144 men and 3,571
women, excluding children, that of the Nez Percés in
Oregon, taken in 1851 by Dr. Dart, 698 men and 1,182
women.<a id="FNanchor_2894_2894" href="#Footnote_2894_2894" class="fnanchor">2894</a> Among the Blackfeet and Shiyann, according to
Mr. Morgan—among the Puncahs and some other tribes,
according to Mr. Catlin—the number of women is said to be
twice as large as that of men, and in some cases even three
times as large.<a id="FNanchor_2895_2895" href="#Footnote_2895_2895" class="fnanchor">2895</a></p>

<p>In Yucatan, according to Stephens, there are two women
to one man; among the Guaranies, according to Azara,
fourteen women to thirteen men; in Cochabamba, according
to Gibbon, even five to one.<a id="FNanchor_2896_2896" href="#Footnote_2896_2896" class="fnanchor">2896</a> Among the Zapotecs and
other nations of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the women are
greatly in excess of the men;<a id="FNanchor_2897_2897" href="#Footnote_2897_2897" class="fnanchor">2897</a> whereas, among the Tarumas,<a id="FNanchor_2898_2898" href="#Footnote_2898_2898" class="fnanchor">2898</a>
Avanos, Maypurs,<a id="FNanchor_2899_2899" href="#Footnote_2899_2899" class="fnanchor">2899</a> and Guanas,<a id="FNanchor_2900_2900" href="#Footnote_2900_2900" class="fnanchor">2900</a> the men are stated to be
more numerous than the women. Von Martius says that
among the Indians of Brazil, the number varied in some
villages in favour of the male sex, in others in favour of the
female.<a id="FNanchor_2901_2901" href="#Footnote_2901_2901" class="fnanchor">2901</a></p>

<p>In Australia the men seem generally to be in the majority.<a id="FNanchor_2902_2902" href="#Footnote_2902_2902" class="fnanchor">2902</a>
Speaking of the Australian natives, the Rev. L. Fison says,
“I think we may suppose that the number of males generally
exceeds that of females among the lower savages; at least,
quite a number of observers declare that such is the fact.”<a id="FNanchor_2903_2903" href="#Footnote_2903_2903" class="fnanchor">2903</a>
Among the Western Australians, according to Mr. Oldfield,
at all times the males are in excess of the other sex.”<a id="FNanchor_2904_2904" href="#Footnote_2904_2904" class="fnanchor">2904</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
Wilhelmi makes a similar statement with regard to several
other tribes;<a id="FNanchor_2905_2905" href="#Footnote_2905_2905" class="fnanchor">2905</a> but this rule does not apply to all the
Australians. “On Herbert River,” says Herr Lumholtz, “the
women are more numerous than the men; this is also the
case among the tribes south-west of the Carpentarian Gulf
and elsewhere. But, according to accurate observations, the
opposite is the case in a large part of Australia.”<a id="FNanchor_2906_2906" href="#Footnote_2906_2906" class="fnanchor">2906</a> In some
tribes of the interior, Mr. Sturt found that among children
there were about two girls to one boy.<a id="FNanchor_2907_2907" href="#Footnote_2907_2907" class="fnanchor">2907</a></p>

<p>In Tasmania, according to Breton, the men greatly exceeded
the women in number.<a id="FNanchor_2908_2908" href="#Footnote_2908_2908" class="fnanchor">2908</a> So also in Tahiti, where, at
the time of Mr. Ellis’s arrival, there were probably four or
five men to one woman;<a id="FNanchor_2909_2909" href="#Footnote_2909_2909" class="fnanchor">2909</a> in Maupiti, where the disproportion
between the sexes among adults was at the rate of
three men to two women;<a id="FNanchor_2910_2910" href="#Footnote_2910_2910" class="fnanchor">2910</a> and in Easter Island, where,
according to the estimates of Cook and La Pérouse, the men
were twice as numerous as the women.<a id="FNanchor_2911_2911" href="#Footnote_2911_2911" class="fnanchor">2911</a> In the Sandwich
Islands, Nukahiva, and some islands belonging to the
Solomon Group, the male sex predominated;<a id="FNanchor_2912_2912" href="#Footnote_2912_2912" class="fnanchor">2912</a> and among
the Maoris, according to a census taken in the year 1881, there
were 24,370 men and 19,729 women.<a id="FNanchor_2913_2913" href="#Footnote_2913_2913" class="fnanchor">2913</a> In Makin Island, of the
Kingsmill Group, on the other hand, Wood represented the
women as outnumbering the men.<a id="FNanchor_2914_2914" href="#Footnote_2914_2914" class="fnanchor">2914</a> The same was to a very
great extent the case in Tukopia;<a id="FNanchor_2915_2915" href="#Footnote_2915_2915" class="fnanchor">2915</a> and d’Albertis says that
in Naiabui, a village in New Guinea with 300 inhabitants,
“there are more women than men by about a third.”<a id="FNanchor_2916_2916" href="#Footnote_2916_2916" class="fnanchor">2916</a> Both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
sexes are nearly equally represented at Port Moresby,<a id="FNanchor_2917_2917" href="#Footnote_2917_2917" class="fnanchor">2917</a> and
according to Marsden, in Sumatra.<a id="FNanchor_2918_2918" href="#Footnote_2918_2918" class="fnanchor">2918</a> In Sarawak the women
are less numerous than the men.<a id="FNanchor_2919_2919" href="#Footnote_2919_2919" class="fnanchor">2919</a></p>

<p>In Ceylon a considerable disparity is exhibited by the
returns. According to Pridham, it is found in the greatest
degree among the Sinhalese, among whom the surplus of
men averages twelve per cent., but it is also observable in the
case of the Malabar population in the northern province, where
the surplus of men averages six per cent.<a id="FNanchor_2920_2920" href="#Footnote_2920_2920" class="fnanchor">2920</a> Robert Orme
states that, in India, the number of women exceeds that of
men;<a id="FNanchor_2921_2921" href="#Footnote_2921_2921" class="fnanchor">2921</a> but this is certainly not the case in every part of the
country. In a census of the North-West Provinces, taken
during the year 1866, the proportions between the sexes were
found to be 100 men to 86·6 women, and, in the Panjab,
even 100 to 81·8.<a id="FNanchor_2922_2922" href="#Footnote_2922_2922" class="fnanchor">2922</a> In some districts of the Himalayas
there is a surplus of males, in others of females.<a id="FNanchor_2923_2923" href="#Footnote_2923_2923" class="fnanchor">2923</a> In Kashmir,
the proportion of men to women is as three to one.<a id="FNanchor_2924_2924" href="#Footnote_2924_2924" class="fnanchor">2924</a> In the
Buddhist country of Ladakh, says Sir A. Cunningham, “it
will be observed that the females outnumber the males, while
the reverse is the case in the Mussulman districts along the
Indus.”<a id="FNanchor_2925_2925" href="#Footnote_2925_2925" class="fnanchor">2925</a> In Malwa, in Central India, the number of women
surpasses the number of men,<a id="FNanchor_2926_2926" href="#Footnote_2926_2926" class="fnanchor">2926</a> and the same, according to Sir
John Bowring, is to a great extent the case in China.<a id="FNanchor_2927_2927" href="#Footnote_2927_2927" class="fnanchor">2927</a> The
Todas of the Neilgherry Hills, on the other hand, amounted
in the year 1867, according to Mr. Breeks, to 455 males and
249 females of all ages, whilst Mr. Marshall some few years
ago found the Toda males of all ages bear the proportion to
females of all ages of 100 to 75.<a id="FNanchor_2928_2928" href="#Footnote_2928_2928" class="fnanchor">2928</a> Among the Mongols, as
we are informed by Prejevalsky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span> “the women are far less
numerous than the men;”<a id="FNanchor_2929_2929" href="#Footnote_2929_2929" class="fnanchor">2929</a> and the same is said to have
been the case with the Massagetæ, and to be the case still in
Kamchatka.<a id="FNanchor_2930_2930" href="#Footnote_2930_2930" class="fnanchor">2930</a></p>

<p>As for the peoples of Africa, I have found two cases only
of an excess of men, the one among the population of Galega,
to the north-east of Madagascar, the other among the
Quissama tribe in Angola.<a id="FNanchor_2931_2931" href="#Footnote_2931_2931" class="fnanchor">2931</a> The reverse seems decidedly to
be the rule. Thus, from Morocco Dr. Churcher writes to me
that “there appears to be a striking disproportion, though
there is no such thing as statistics in this land.” In Ma Bung,
in the Timannee country, Major Laing counted three women
to one man.<a id="FNanchor_2932_2932" href="#Footnote_2932_2932" class="fnanchor">2932</a> A census taken in Lagos in 1872 showed
among the population of African origin, 27,774 men and
32,353 women.<a id="FNanchor_2933_2933" href="#Footnote_2933_2933" class="fnanchor">2933</a> Among the Negroes of the Gold Coast,
according to Bosman; in Latúka, according to Emin Pasha;
among the Waguha of West Tanganyika, according to Mr.
A. J. Swann; among the Wa-taïta, according to Mr. Joseph
Thomson, women predominate.<a id="FNanchor_2934_2934" href="#Footnote_2934_2934" class="fnanchor">2934</a> Mr. Cousins is inclined to
think that the same is the case with the Cis-Natalian Kafirs,
“as there are few bachelors, and the majority of men have
more than one wife.”<a id="FNanchor_2935_2935" href="#Footnote_2935_2935" class="fnanchor">2935</a> In Uganda, says the Rev. C. T. Wilson,
“the female population is largely in excess of the male,
the proportion being about three and a half to one.”<a id="FNanchor_2936_2936" href="#Footnote_2936_2936" class="fnanchor">2936</a></p>

<p>In European countries, the number of men and of women
from fifteen to twenty years of age is generally almost the
same; but in an earlier period of life there are more men
than women, and, in a later, more women than men.<a id="FNanchor_2937_2937" href="#Footnote_2937_2937" class="fnanchor">2937</a></p>

<p>This disparity in the numbers of the sexes is due to various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
causes. The preponderance of women depends to a great
extent upon the higher mortality of men. Dr. Sutherland
found that the average age of 109 Eskimo was nearly 22
years—that of the females 24·5, that of the males 19·3 years.<a id="FNanchor_2938_2938" href="#Footnote_2938_2938" class="fnanchor">2938</a>
The men pass most of their time at sea, in snow and rain,
heat and cold, and many of them are drowned. The result
of this troublesome and dangerous life is that few of them
attain the age of fifty, whereas many women reach the age
of seventy or even eighty. This, according to Dr. King,
is the reason why, among this people, there are generally
fewer men than women.<a id="FNanchor_2939_2939" href="#Footnote_2939_2939" class="fnanchor">2939</a> Mr. Bancroft states that, among
the Ingaliks near the mouth of the Yukon, some of the
women reach sixty, while the men rarely attain more than
forty-five years.<a id="FNanchor_2940_2940" href="#Footnote_2940_2940" class="fnanchor">2940</a> In Europe, the death-rate is higher among
men than among women, partly because of the greater dangers
they are exposed to. Among many savage and barbarous
peoples, however, the greater mortality of the male population
depends chiefly upon the destructive influence of war.<a id="FNanchor_2941_2941" href="#Footnote_2941_2941" class="fnanchor">2941</a> “As
all nations of Indians in their natural condition,” says Mr.
Catlin, “are unceasingly at war with the tribes that are
about them, ... their warriors are killed off to that extent,
that in many instances two, or sometimes three women to a
man are found in a tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_2942_2942" href="#Footnote_2942_2942" class="fnanchor">2942</a> According to Ellis, it is supposed
by the Missionaries in Madagascar that, in consequence of the
destructive ravages of war, in some of the provinces there are
among the free portion of the inhabitants five, and in other
three, women to one man, whilst the proportion of the sexes
seems to be equal at birth.<a id="FNanchor_2943_2943" href="#Footnote_2943_2943" class="fnanchor">2943</a> But I am inclined to think that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
this cause operates principally at tolerably advanced stages
of civilization, and only in a smaller degree among the rudest
savages, who, devoid of any definite tribal organization, live a
wandering life, scattered in families or hordes consisting of a
few persons. Thus, with regard to the Yahgans of Tierra del
Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes to me, “On several occasions when
some hundreds of natives have been gathered together, I have
taken censuses of them, and have always found the sexes
equal or nearly so.... War was unknown, though fightings
were frequent, but women took part in them as energetically
as the men, and suffered equally with them—if anything,
more.” Among the Australians also, as we have seen, wars
do not cause any disproportion between the sexes.</p>

<p>The surplus of males is often due to female infanticide;<a id="FNanchor_2944_2944" href="#Footnote_2944_2944" class="fnanchor">2944</a>
and among certain peoples there is another cause which must
be taken into account. Captain Lewin states that, among
the Toungtha, women die at a comparatively early age
because of the constant labour which their sex entails upon
them, whereas the men live very long.<a id="FNanchor_2945_2945" href="#Footnote_2945_2945" class="fnanchor">2945</a> And the same is
said by Mr. Kirby with regard to the Kutchin.<a id="FNanchor_2946_2946" href="#Footnote_2946_2946" class="fnanchor">2946</a></p>

<p>Moreover, there is a disproportion between the sexes at
birth. Among some peoples more boys are born, among others
more girls; and the surplus is often considerable. Mr. Ross
thinks that, among the Eastern Tinneh, “the proportion of
births is rather in favour of females,” whilst the Aht women
seem to have more boys than girls.<a id="FNanchor_2947_2947" href="#Footnote_2947_2947" class="fnanchor">2947</a> Von Humboldt found
by examining baptismal registers, that more boys than girls
were born in some communities of New Spain.<a id="FNanchor_2948_2948" href="#Footnote_2948_2948" class="fnanchor">2948</a> The same,
according to M. Belly, is the case among the Indians of
Guatemala and Nicaragua.<a id="FNanchor_2949_2949" href="#Footnote_2949_2949" class="fnanchor">2949</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span></p>

<p>In the interior of Australia, Mr. Sturt met with several
smaller tribes in which the number of girls was considerably
greater than the number of boys, though in other tribes the
proportion of births is in favour of males.<a id="FNanchor_2950_2950" href="#Footnote_2950_2950" class="fnanchor">2950</a> Sir. G. Grey drew
up a list of 222 births, and of these 93 were females,
129 males.<a id="FNanchor_2951_2951" href="#Footnote_2951_2951" class="fnanchor">2951</a> In Tasmania, where the men were more
numerous than the women, female infanticide was very rare.<a id="FNanchor_2952_2952" href="#Footnote_2952_2952" class="fnanchor">2952</a>
The same is the case with the Sinhalese. They hold in
abhorrence the crime of exposing children, says Dr. Davy;
and it is never committed except in some of the wildest
parts of the country, and even there only when the parents
themselves are on the brink of starvation, and must either
sacrifice a part of the family or die.<a id="FNanchor_2953_2953" href="#Footnote_2953_2953" class="fnanchor">2953</a> Haeckel assures us
that among this people there is a permanent disproportion
between male and female births, ten boys being
born, on the average, to eight or nine girls.<a id="FNanchor_2954_2954" href="#Footnote_2954_2954" class="fnanchor">2954</a> Among the
Todas, as we are informed by Mr. Marshall, the male
children under fourteen years of age bear to the female
children of the same period—ages estimated from their
personal appearance—the ratio of 100 to 80·0,<a id="FNanchor_2955_2955" href="#Footnote_2955_2955" class="fnanchor">2955</a> though female
infanticide is never practised, having long since become
extinct through the action of the British Government.<a id="FNanchor_2956_2956" href="#Footnote_2956_2956" class="fnanchor">2956</a>
Mr. Man’s inquiries tended to show that, among the
Andamanese, there is a slight predominance of female over
male births.<a id="FNanchor_2957_2957" href="#Footnote_2957_2957" class="fnanchor">2957</a></p>

<p>Bruce observes, “From a diligent inquiry into the South
and Scripture-part of Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Syria, from
Mousul (or Nineveh) to Aleppo and Antioch, I find the proportion
to be fully two women born to one man. There is
indeed, a fraction over, but not a considerable one. From
Latikea, Laodicea ad mare, down the coast of Syria to Sidon,
the number is very nearly three, or two and three-fourths to
one man. Through the Holy Land, the country called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
Horan, in the Isthmus of Suez, and the parts of the Delta,
unfrequented by strangers, it is something less than three.
But from Suez to the Straits of Babelmandeb, which contains
the three Arabias, the portion is fully four women to one
man, which, I have reason to believe, holds as far as the
Line, and 30° beyond it.” The manner in which Bruce came
to these conclusions he describes as follows:—“Whenever I
went into a town, village, or inhabited place, dwelt long in a
mountain, or travelled journeys with any set of people, I
always made it my business to inquire how many children
they had, or their fathers, their next neighbours, or acquaintance.
This not being a captious question, or what any one
would scruple to answer, there was no interest to deceive....
I say, therefore, that a medium of both sexes arising
from three or four hundred families indiscriminately taken,
shall be the proportion in which one differs from the
other.”<a id="FNanchor_2958_2958" href="#Footnote_2958_2958" class="fnanchor">2958</a></p>

<p>This statement has been contradicted, but, so far as I
know, it has not been proved to be wholly without foundation.
It is to some extent made credible by what Dr.
Churcher informs me regarding the disproportion of the
sexes among the Moors of Morocco. As the result of his
own observation, and that of a Mohammedan friend of his,
he writes, “There is certainly a disproportion also at birth....
It would be safe to say that the female births are in
the proportion of three females to one male; this partly
accounts for the great rejoicing when a son is born. It
reacts, however, in this way, that the people say, ‘Allah has
given us more women than men, hence it is evident that
polygamy is of God.’” In the Monbuttu country, according
to Emin Pasha, “far more female children are born than
males.”<a id="FNanchor_2959_2959" href="#Footnote_2959_2959" class="fnanchor">2959</a> And, regarding the disproportion between the
sexes in Uganda, Mr. Wilson says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span> “Careful observation
has established the fact that there are a good many more
female births than male, and, on taking the groups of children
playing by the roadside, there will always be found to be
more girls than boys.”<a id="FNanchor_2960_2960" href="#Footnote_2960_2960" class="fnanchor">2960</a> Confronted by these definite statements,
and by the fact that, in many African countries, there
is a striking excess of women, we cannot with Süssmilch and
Chervin<a id="FNanchor_2961_2961" href="#Footnote_2961_2961" class="fnanchor">2961</a> dismiss as wholly groundless Montesquieu’s well-known
assertion that in the hot regions of the Old World
more girls are born than boys,<a id="FNanchor_2962_2962" href="#Footnote_2962_2962" class="fnanchor">2962</a> although such disproportion
certainly does not exist in every tropical country.</p>

<p>In Europe, the average male births outnumber the female
by about five per cent., the still-born being excluded. But
the rate varies in the different countries. Thus, in Russian
Poland, only 101 boys are born to 100 girls, whilst, in
Roumania and Greece, the proportion is 111 to 100.<a id="FNanchor_2963_2963" href="#Footnote_2963_2963" class="fnanchor">2963</a>
The excess of male over female births is less when they
are illegitimate than when legitimate.<a id="FNanchor_2964_2964" href="#Footnote_2964_2964" class="fnanchor">2964</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ever since Aristotle’s days inquirers have sought to discover
the causes which determine the sex of the offspring;
but no conclusion commanding general assent has yet been
arrived at. The law of Hofacker and Sadler, according to
which more boys are born if the husband is older than the
wife, more girls if the wife is older than the husband, has
attracted the greatest number of adherents.<a id="FNanchor_2965_2965" href="#Footnote_2965_2965" class="fnanchor">2965</a> But Noirot and
Breslau have lately come to the opposite result, and, from
the data of Norwegian statistics, Berner has shown that the
law is untenable.<a id="FNanchor_2966_2966" href="#Footnote_2966_2966" class="fnanchor">2966</a> Dr. Goehlert has modified it so far that
he holds the sex to be influenced, not by the relative, but by
the absolute ages of the parents.<a id="FNanchor_2967_2967" href="#Footnote_2967_2967" class="fnanchor">2967</a> But W. Stieda has found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
from the registers of births in Alsace-Lorraine, that neither
the relative nor the absolute ages of the parents exercise this
sort of influence.<a id="FNanchor_2968_2968" href="#Footnote_2968_2968" class="fnanchor">2968</a> Again, Platter, in a paper in ‘Statistische
Monatsschrift’ (Vienna) for 1875, concludes from the examination
of thirty million births that the less the difference
in the age of the parents the greater is the probability of
boys being born.<a id="FNanchor_2969_2969" href="#Footnote_2969_2969" class="fnanchor">2969</a></p>

<p>It has, further, been suggested that polygyny leads to the
birth of a greater proportion of female infants.<a id="FNanchor_2970_2970" href="#Footnote_2970_2970" class="fnanchor">2970</a> Dr. J.
Campbell, however, who carefully attended to this subject in
the harems of Siam, concludes that the proportion of male
to female births is the same as from monogamous unions.<a id="FNanchor_2971_2971" href="#Footnote_2971_2971" class="fnanchor">2971</a>
It has also been maintained, in a paper read before the
“Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland” by
Mr. John Sanderson, that, among the Kafirs resident in
Natal and the adjoining countries, there was no surplus of
female births in polygynous families.<a id="FNanchor_2972_2972" href="#Footnote_2972_2972" class="fnanchor">2972</a> The mass of facts
collected by Mr. Sanderson is, however, too small to warrant
any positive general deductions, and the like must be said of
the information on the subject which Mr. Cousins and Mr.
Eyles have sent me from the same part of South Africa.
According to M. Remy and Mr. Hyde, on the other hand, the
censuses of the Mormons show a great excess of female births.<a id="FNanchor_2973_2973" href="#Footnote_2973_2973" class="fnanchor">2973</a>
But it is impossible to believe that polygynous intercourse <i>per
se</i> can cause such an excess. Hardly any animal, as Mr. Darwin
remarks, has been rendered so highly polygynous as
English race-horses; nevertheless, their male and female
offspring are almost exactly equal in number.<a id="FNanchor_2974_2974" href="#Footnote_2974_2974" class="fnanchor">2974</a></p>

<p>Of all the theories relating to this subject, the one set
forth by Dr. Düsing<a id="FNanchor_2975_2975" href="#Footnote_2975_2975" class="fnanchor">2975</a> is by far the most important. Accord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>ing
to him, the characters of animals and plants which
influence the formation of sex are due to natural selection.
In every species, the proportion between the sexes has a
tendency to keep constant, but the organisms are so well
adapted to the conditions of life that, under anomalous circumstances,
they produce more individuals of that sex of
which there is the greatest need. When nourishment is
abundant, strengthened reproduction is an advantage to the
species, whereas the reverse is the case when nourishment is
scarce. Hence—the power of multiplication depending
chiefly upon the number of females—organisms, when unusually
well nourished, produce comparatively more female
offspring; in the opposite case, more male. Dr. Düsing and,
before him, Dr. Ploss,<a id="FNanchor_2976_2976" href="#Footnote_2976_2976" class="fnanchor">2976</a> have adduced several remarkable
facts which seem to indicate that such a connection between
abundance and the production of females, and between
scarcity and the production of males, actually exists. It is, for
example, a common opinion among furriers that rich regions
give more female furs, poor regions more male.<a id="FNanchor_2977_2977" href="#Footnote_2977_2977" class="fnanchor">2977</a> It is an
established fact that male births are in greater excess in
country districts, the population of which is often badly fed,
than in towns, where the conditions of life are shown to be,
as a rule, more luxurious.<a id="FNanchor_2978_2978" href="#Footnote_2978_2978" class="fnanchor">2978</a> A similar excess is found among
poor people as compared with the well-off classes.<a id="FNanchor_2979_2979" href="#Footnote_2979_2979" class="fnanchor">2979</a> Especially
remarkable is Dr. Ploss’s statement that in highlands
comparatively more boys are born than in lowlands. He
found that, in Saxony, in the years 1847-1849, the proportion
between male and female births was 105·9 to 100 in the
region not exceeding 500 Paris feet above the level of the
sea; 107·3 to 100, at a height of between 1,001 and 1,500<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
feet; and 107·8 to 100, at a height of between 1,501 and
2,000.<a id="FNanchor_2980_2980" href="#Footnote_2980_2980" class="fnanchor">2980</a></p>

<p>The evidence adduced by Dr. Ploss and Dr. Düsing is certainly
not strong enough to permit us to regard their inference
otherwise than as an hypothesis. But it is an
hypothesis in which there seems to be some truth. There are
ethnological facts which fully harmonize with it.</p>

<p>According to the census made by the collectors of districts
in 1814, the whole population of the old English possessions
in Ceylon formed a grand total of 475,883 souls, the males
outnumbering the females by 27,193. Above the age of
puberty there were 156,447 males, and 142,453 females;
below that age, 95,091 males, and 81,892 females. Davy, who
thinks that the census is not far from the truth, remarks,
“The disproportion appears to be greatest in the poorest
parts of the country, where the population is thinnest, and it
is most difficult to support life; and smallest where there is
least want. Indeed, in some of the fishing villages, where
there is abundance of food, the number of females rather
exceeds that of the males. May it not be a wise provision
of provident Nature to promote, by extreme poverty, the
generation of males rather than of females?”<a id="FNanchor_2981_2981" href="#Footnote_2981_2981" class="fnanchor">2981</a></p>

<p>Very remarkable is the striking coincidence of polyandry
with the great poverty of the countries in which it prevails.
It seems to be beyond doubt that this practice, as a rule, is
due to scarcity of women. This is the view taken by most of
the authorities to whom we owe our knowledge of polyandrous
peoples.<a id="FNanchor_2982_2982" href="#Footnote_2982_2982" class="fnanchor">2982</a> And this disproportion between the sexes cannot,
at least in many instances, be explained as a result of female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
infanticide. It was formerly said that the excess of men
among the Todas was owing to the fact that all the girls
beyond a certain number were destroyed in the cradle; but
later investigations, as we have seen, show that the excess
depends upon a striking disproportion between male and
female births. Dr. Seemann states that, among those Eskimo
tribes who practise polyandry, and among whom men are more
numerous than women, female infanticide seems to be unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2983_2983" href="#Footnote_2983_2983" class="fnanchor">2983</a>
With regard to the inhabitants of the Jounsar district
of the Himalayas, Mr. Dunlop says, “Wherever the practice of
polyandry exists, there is a striking discrepance in the proportions
of the sexes among young children as well as adults;
thus, in a village where I have found upwards of four hundred
boys, there were only one hundred and twenty girls, yet the
temptations to female infanticide, owing to expensive marriages
and extravagant dowers which exist among the
Rajputs of the plains, are not found in the hills where the
marriages are comparatively inexpensive, and where the wife,
instead of bringing a large dowry, is usually purchased for a
considerable sum from her parents. In the Garhwal Hills,
moreover, where polygamy is prevalent, there is a surplus of
female children.... I am inclined to give more weight to
Nature’s adaptability to national habit, than to the possibility
of infanticide being the cause of the discrepance found
in Jounsar.”<a id="FNanchor_2984_2984" href="#Footnote_2984_2984" class="fnanchor">2984</a> Female infants are killed only where they are
a burden to the family or community to which they belong.
But it will be shown subsequently that this is by no means
the case with the inhabitants of the Himalayas. Hence it
seems almost probable that, among the polyandrous peoples
of these regions, as among the Todas and Sinhalese, more
boys are born than girls.</p>

<p>It has been said that Tibetan polyandry depends upon the
scarcity of women in a marriageable state, and that this
scarcity is due to the Lama nunneries absorbing so many of
the girls.<a id="FNanchor_2985_2985" href="#Footnote_2985_2985" class="fnanchor">2985</a> But Koeppen clears the religion of Tibet of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
responsibility for polyandry, showing that the practice existed
in the country before the introduction of Buddhism.<a id="FNanchor_2986_2986" href="#Footnote_2986_2986" class="fnanchor">2986</a> Mr.
Baber states the very remarkable fact that “polygamy obtains
in valleys, while polyandry prevails in the uplands.”<a id="FNanchor_2987_2987" href="#Footnote_2987_2987" class="fnanchor">2987</a> According
to Mr. Rockhill, “female infanticide is not practised
in Tibet, except among the women married to Chinese;”<a id="FNanchor_2988_2988" href="#Footnote_2988_2988" class="fnanchor">2988</a>
and Grosier and Du Halde expressly assert that more males
than females are born there.<a id="FNanchor_2989_2989" href="#Footnote_2989_2989" class="fnanchor">2989</a></p>

<p>Much stress must be laid on the fact that polyandry
prevails chiefly in poor countries. “Polyandry,” says Lieutenant
Cunningham, “appears to be essential in a country in
which the quantity of cultivable land is limited, and in which
pastures are not extensive, in which there are but few facilities
for carrying on commerce, and in which there is no
mineral wealth readily made available.”<a id="FNanchor_2990_2990" href="#Footnote_2990_2990" class="fnanchor">2990</a> “Il est connu,” says
M. Vinson, “que sur la côte de Malabar la polyandrie a été
établie pour obvier à la pénurie des subsistances.”<a id="FNanchor_2991_2991" href="#Footnote_2991_2991" class="fnanchor">2991</a> The
Santals live in a country a great part of which is poor and
sterile.<a id="FNanchor_2992_2992" href="#Footnote_2992_2992" class="fnanchor">2992</a> Regarding the Kunawari, Miss Gordon Cumming
remarks, “There is a curious distinction in the social customs
of the people in the upper and lower part of this valley.
Below Wangtu it is said that polygamy prevails, as elsewhere;
every man buying his wives from their parents for a given
number of rupees.... Farther up the valley, however,
where the people are very poor, and the tiny ridges of cultivation
will not support large families, polyandry is common.”<a id="FNanchor_2993_2993" href="#Footnote_2993_2993" class="fnanchor">2993</a>
Speaking of the Botis of Ladakh, Sir A. Cunningham asserts
that polyandry “was a most politic measure for a poor country
which does not produce sufficient food for its inhabitants.”<a id="FNanchor_2994_2994" href="#Footnote_2994_2994" class="fnanchor">2994</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
Mr. Bellew holds the same view with regard to polyandry in
Lammayru in Ladakh:—“The population is kept down to a
proportion which the country is capable of supporting. For
the only parts of it which are habitable are the narrow valleys
through which its rivers flow, and the little nooks in the
mountains which are watered by their torrent tributaries.”<a id="FNanchor_2995_2995" href="#Footnote_2995_2995" class="fnanchor">2995</a>
According to Mr. Wilson, even one of the Moravian missionaries
defended the polyandry of the Tibetans “as good for
the heathen of so sterile a country,” since superabundant population
in an unfertile country, would be a great calamity and
produce “eternal warfare or eternal want.”<a id="FNanchor_2996_2996" href="#Footnote_2996_2996" class="fnanchor">2996</a> A similar opinion
is pronounced by Koeppen, Turner, de Ujfalvy, and Wilson.<a id="FNanchor_2997_2997" href="#Footnote_2997_2997" class="fnanchor">2997</a></p>

<p>It is commonly asserted that this coincidence of polyandry
with poverty of material resources depends upon the intention
of the people to check an increase of population, or upon
the fact that the men are not rich enough to support or buy
wives for themselves. But the accuracy of these assumptions
is very doubtful. Among no polyandrous people, except the
Tibetans with their nunneries do we know of a class of unmarried
women. Moreover, even if a woman is sometimes a
burden to her husband in a tribe that lives by hunting, her
position is very different among a pastoral or agricultural
people. In the Himalayas, as Mr. Fraser remarks, women
are useful in the fields and in domestic labours, and fully earn
their own subsistence.<a id="FNanchor_2998_2998" href="#Footnote_2998_2998" class="fnanchor">2998</a> Again, Turner, who had many opportunities
of seeing Western Tibet, asserts that polyandry there
is not confined to the lower ranks alone, but is frequently found
in the most opulent families,—a statement with which Mr.
Wilson agrees.<a id="FNanchor_2999_2999" href="#Footnote_2999_2999" class="fnanchor">2999</a> In Ceylon, as we have seen, it prevails chiefly
among the wealthier classes.<a id="FNanchor_3000_3000" href="#Footnote_3000_3000" class="fnanchor">3000</a> And in the villages of the
Kotegarh district in the Himalayas, according to Dr. Stulpnagel,
most of the cases of polyandry are found among well-to-do
peoples. “It is the poor,” he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span> “who prefer polygamy,
on account of the value of the women as household drudges.”<a id="FNanchor_3001_3001" href="#Footnote_3001_3001" class="fnanchor">3001</a>
All these facts are certainly in favour of Dr. Düsing’s theory;
and Dr. Floss’s statement as to the excess of male births in
the highlands of Saxony becomes very important when we
consider that polyandry chiefly occurs among mountaineers—in
South Africa, as we have seen, as well as in Asia.</p>

<p>Dr. Düsing has, moreover, inferred that incest is less
common in proportion as the number of males is great.
The more males, he says, the farther off they have to go
from their birthplace to find mates. Incest is injurious
to the species; hence incestuous unions have a tendency to
produce an excess of male offspring.<a id="FNanchor_3002_3002" href="#Footnote_3002_3002" class="fnanchor">3002</a> Thus, according to
Dr. Nagel, certain plants, when self-fertilized, produce an
excess of male flowers. According to Dr. Goehlert’s
statistical investigation, in the case of horses, the more the
parent animals differ in colour, the more the female foals
outnumber the male.<a id="FNanchor_3003_3003" href="#Footnote_3003_3003" class="fnanchor">3003</a> Among the Jews, many of whom
marry cousins, there is a remarkable excess of male births.
In country districts where, as we have seen, comparatively
more boys are born than in towns, marriage more frequently
takes place between kinsfolk. It is for a similar reason, says
Dr. Düsing, that illegitimate unions show a tendency to
produce female births.<a id="FNanchor_3004_3004" href="#Footnote_3004_3004" class="fnanchor">3004</a></p>

<p>The evidence given by Dr. Düsing for the correctness of
his deduction is, then, exceedingly scanty—if, indeed, it can
be called evidence. Nevertheless, I think his main conclusion
holds good. Independently of his reasoning, I had come to
exactly the same result in a purely inductive way. There is
some ground for believing that mixture of race produces an
excess of female births. In his work on the ‘Tribes of
California,’ Mr. Powers observes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span> “It is a curious fact, which
has frequently come under my observation, and has been
abundantly confirmed by the pioneers, that among half-breed
children a decided majority are girls.... Often I have
seen whole families of half-breed girls, but never one
composed entirely of boys, and seldom one wherein they
were more numerous.”<a id="FNanchor_3005_3005" href="#Footnote_3005_3005" class="fnanchor">3005</a> When I mentioned this statement
to a gentleman who had spent many years in British
Columbia and other parts of North America, he replied that
he himself had made exactly the same observation. Mr.
Starkweather has found that, according to the United States
statistical tables of the sex of mulattoes born in the Southern
States, there is an excess of from 12 to 15 per cent. of
female mulatto children, whilst, taking the whole population
together, the male births show an excess of 5 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_3006_3006" href="#Footnote_3006_3006" class="fnanchor">3006</a>
In Central America, according to Colonel Galindo, “an extraordinary
excess is observable in the births of white and
Ladino females over those of the males, the former being
in proportion to the latter as six, or at least as five, to four:
among the Indians the births of males and females are
about equal.”<a id="FNanchor_3007_3007" href="#Footnote_3007_3007" class="fnanchor">3007</a> Mr. Stephens asserts that, among the Ladinos
of Yucatan, the proportion is even as two to one.<a id="FNanchor_3008_3008" href="#Footnote_3008_3008" class="fnanchor">3008</a> Taken in
connection with the fact mentioned by Mr. Squier, that the
whites in Central America are as one to eight in comparison
with the mixed population,<a id="FNanchor_3009_3009" href="#Footnote_3009_3009" class="fnanchor">3009</a> these statements accord well with
the following observation of M. Belly as regards Nicaragua:—“Ce
qui me paraît être le fait général,” he says, “c’est que
dans les villes où l’élément blanc domine, il se procrée en effet
plus de filles que de garçons.... Mais dans les campagnes
et partout où la race Indienne l’emporte, c’est le contraire qui
se produit, et dès lors la prépondérance du sexe masculin se
maintient par la prépondérance de l’élément indigène. Le
même phénomène avait déjà été observé au Mexique.”<a id="FNanchor_3010_3010" href="#Footnote_3010_3010" class="fnanchor">3010</a></p>

<p>Concerning the proportion of the sexes at birth among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
mixed races of South America, I have unfortunately no
definite statements at my disposal. But Mr. J. S. Roberton
informs me, from Chañaral in Chili, that in that country,
with its numerous mongrels, more females are born than
males. According to the list of the population of the
capitaina of São Paulo, in the year 1815, given by v. Spix
and v. Martius—a list which includes more than 200,000
persons,—the proportion between women and men is, among
the mulattoes, 114·65 to 100; among the whites, 109·3
to 100; among the blacks, 100 to 129.<a id="FNanchor_3011_3011" href="#Footnote_3011_3011" class="fnanchor">3011</a> But this last
proportion is of no consequence, as we have no account of the
number of negro slaves annually imported into the capitaina.
Sir R. F. Burton found, from the census returns of 1859 for
the town of São João d’El Rei, where there is a large intermixture
of the white race with the coloured women, an
excess of nearly 50 per cent. of women as compared with
men.<a id="FNanchor_3012_3012" href="#Footnote_3012_3012" class="fnanchor">3012</a> A census of the population in the Province of Rio,
taken in the year 1844, also shows a considerable excess of
women, not only, however, among the mixed population, but
among the Indian and negro creoles as well;<a id="FNanchor_3013_3013" href="#Footnote_3013_3013" class="fnanchor">3013</a> and M. de
Castelnau was astonished at the disproportionately large
number of females in Goyaz.<a id="FNanchor_3014_3014" href="#Footnote_3014_3014" class="fnanchor">3014</a></p>

<p>In the northern parts of the United States, according to
Kohl, female children predominate in the families of the
cross-breeds arising from the intercourse of Frenchmen
with Indian women.<a id="FNanchor_3015_3015" href="#Footnote_3015_3015" class="fnanchor">3015</a> This statement is very much like
Graf v. Görtz’s, that the families of the offspring of Dutchmen
and Malay women in Java (Lipplapps) consist chiefly of
daughters.<a id="FNanchor_3016_3016" href="#Footnote_3016_3016" class="fnanchor">3016</a> A census taken in the eighteenth century, given
by Süssmilch, proves also that among these mongrels there
is a great excess of women over men.<a id="FNanchor_3017_3017" href="#Footnote_3017_3017" class="fnanchor">3017</a> From Stanley Pool
in Congo, Dr. Sims writes to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span> “It is the subject of general
remark here, that the half-caste children are generally girls;
out of ten I can count, two only are boys.” At the same
time he states that, among the native Bateke people, no
disproportion between the sexes is observable. Mr. Cousins
informs me that, in the western province of Cis-Natalian
Kafirland, in the “Karoo” district from Caledon up to
Mossel Bay, there is a half-caste or mixed race called “Bruin
Menschen,” generally known as bastards, among whom more
females than males are born. Dr. Felkin found that, among
the foreign women imported to Uganda, the excess of
females in the first births was enormous, <i>viz.</i>, 510 females to
100 males, as compared with 102 females to 100 males in
first births from pure Waganda women; whilst in subsequent
pregnancies of these imported women the ratio was 137
females to 100 males. As a matter of fact, in the families
of the poorer classes of Uganda, who “do all in their power
to marry pure Waganda women,” the sexes are as evenly
balanced as in Europe, whereas this is certainly not the case
among the children of chiefs and wealthy men who have large
harems supplied mainly with foreign wives. “I found,” says
Dr. Felkin, “that of the women captured by the slave-raiders
in Central Africa, and brought down to the East Coast,
either near Zanzibar or through the Soudan to the Red Sea,
those who had been impregnated on the way usually produced
female children. Hence the Soudan slave-dealers, instead of
having only one slave to sell, have a woman and a female
child.”<a id="FNanchor_3018_3018" href="#Footnote_3018_3018" class="fnanchor">3018</a> Dr. Felkin suggests, as an explanation of this excess
of female births, that the temporarily superior parent
produces the opposite sex; but the facts stated seem strongly
to corroborate the theory that intermixture of race is in
favour of female births. Very remarkable are two statements
in the Talmud, that mixed marriages produce only girls.<a id="FNanchor_3019_3019" href="#Footnote_3019_3019" class="fnanchor">3019</a>
Mr. Jacobs informs me that his collection of Jewish statistics
includes details of 118 mixed marriages; of these 28
are sterile, and in the remainder there are 145 female children
and 122 male—that is, 118·82 to 100 males.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span></p>

<p>We must not, of course, take for granted that what applies
to certain races of men holds good for all of them; but it
should be observed that the cases mentioned refer to mongrels
of very different kinds. It is indeed scarcely probable that
anything else than the crossing can be the cause of this excess
of females, as facts tend to show that unions between
related individuals or, generally, between individuals who
are very like each other, produce a comparatively great
number of male offspring.</p>

<p>In all the in-and-in bred stocks of the Bates herd at
Kirklevington, according to Mr. Bell, the number of bull
calves was constantly very far in excess of the heifers.<a id="FNanchor_3020_3020" href="#Footnote_3020_3020" class="fnanchor">3020</a> Of
the in-and-in bred Warlaby branch of short-horns, Mr. Carr
says that it “appears to have a most destructive propensity
to breed bulls.”<a id="FNanchor_3021_3021" href="#Footnote_3021_3021" class="fnanchor">3021</a> Dr. Goehlert’s statement as regards
horses, just referred to, is corroborated by Crampe’s investigations,
which included more than two thousand
different cases, all tending to prove that female foals predominate
in proportion as the parent animals differ in
colour.<a id="FNanchor_3022_3022" href="#Footnote_3022_3022" class="fnanchor">3022</a></p>

<p>We have seen that the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills are
probably the most in-and-in bred people of whom anything
is known, and we have also seen how, among them, the
disproportion between male and female births is strikingly in
favour of the males. Among the Badagas, a neighbouring
people, who, like the Todas, have numerous subdivisions of
caste, each of which differs in some social or ceremonial custom,<a id="FNanchor_3023_3023" href="#Footnote_3023_3023" class="fnanchor">3023</a>
and all of which, probably, are endogamous, there is
also a considerable surplus of men.<a id="FNanchor_3024_3024" href="#Footnote_3024_3024" class="fnanchor">3024</a> Now it is very remarkable
that in another tribe inhabiting the same hill ranges, the
Kotars, who do not intermarry with the inhabitants of their
own village, but always seek a wife from another “kotagiri,”
women are not so scarce as among the Todas and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
Badagas.<a id="FNanchor_3025_3025" href="#Footnote_3025_3025" class="fnanchor">3025</a> Among the endogamous Maoris, the men outnumber
the women. So also among the Sinhalese, who consider
marriage between the father’s sister’s son and the
mother’s brother’s daughter the most proper union. Among
the polyandrous Arabs mentioned by Strabo, marriage between
cousins was the rule. The polyandrous mountaineer
of South Africa, in almost every case, marries a daughter
of his father’s brother.<a id="FNanchor_3026_3026" href="#Footnote_3026_3026" class="fnanchor">3026</a> And with the Jews, among whom
cousin marriages occur perhaps three times as often as among
the surrounding populations,<a id="FNanchor_3027_3027" href="#Footnote_3027_3027" class="fnanchor">3027</a> the proportion of births is
probably more in favour of the males than among the non-Jewish
population of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_3028_3028" href="#Footnote_3028_3028" class="fnanchor">3028</a> All these facts, taken together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
seem to render it probable that the degree of differentiation
in the sexual elements of the parents exercises some
influence upon the sex of the offspring, so that, when the
differentiation is unusually great, the births are in favour of
females; when it is unusually small, in favour of males.</p>

<p>We certainly cannot, from the numerical proportion of the
sexes, especially at birth, draw any inference as to the form
of marriage characteristic of the species. Among birds living
in a state of nature, polyandry is almost unheard of, though,
according to Dr. Brehm, the males are generally more numerous
than the females.<a id="FNanchor_3029_3029" href="#Footnote_3029_3029" class="fnanchor">3029</a> As for man, there are several non-polyandrous
peoples among whom the men are considerably
in excess of the women; whilst among other peoples polygyny
is forbidden, though the women are in excess of the men. Nevertheless,
the form of marriage depends to a great extent upon
the proportion between the male and female population. Polyandry,
as already said, is due chiefly to a surplus of men,
though it prevails only where the circumstances are otherwise
in favour of it. And, as regards polygyny, I cannot agree
with M. Chervin that it is quite independent of the proportion
between the sexes.<a id="FNanchor_3030_3030" href="#Footnote_3030_3030" class="fnanchor">3030</a> It has been observed that, in India, polyandry
occurs in those parts of the country where the males
outnumber the females, polygyny in those where the reverse
is the case.<a id="FNanchor_3031_3031" href="#Footnote_3031_3031" class="fnanchor">3031</a> Indeed, in countries unaffected by European
civilization, polygyny seems to prevail wherever women form
the majority.</p>

<p>Thus the causes which determine the proportion of the
sexes exercise some influence also upon the form of marriage.
Among the Eskimo, for instance, who, according to Armstrong,
take more than one wife when the women are sufficiently
numerous,<a id="FNanchor_3032_3032" href="#Footnote_3032_3032" class="fnanchor">3032</a> polygyny results chiefly from the dangerous
life the men have to lead in order to gain their subsistence.
Among the Indians of North America, it is, to a large extent,
due to the wars which destroy many of the male population.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
In certain countries it seems to be furthered by physiological
conditions leading to an excess of female births. As for
polyandry, we have some reason to believe that it is due, on
the one hand, to poor conditions of life, on the other to close
intermarrying. As a matter of fact, the chief polyandrous
peoples either live in sterile mountain regions, or are endogamous
in a very high degree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are several reasons why a man may desire to possess
more than one wife. First, monogamy requires from him
periodical continence. He has to live apart from his wife,
not only for a certain time every month,<a id="FNanchor_3033_3033" href="#Footnote_3033_3033" class="fnanchor">3033</a> but, among many
peoples, during her pregnancy also.<a id="FNanchor_3034_3034" href="#Footnote_3034_3034" class="fnanchor">3034</a> Among the Shawanese,
for instance, “as soon as a wife is announced to be in a state
of pregnancy, the matrimonial rights are suspended, and
continency preserved with a religious and mystical scrupulosity.”<a id="FNanchor_3035_3035" href="#Footnote_3035_3035" class="fnanchor">3035</a>
This suspension of matrimonial rights is usually
continued till a considerable time after child-birth. Among the
Northern Indians, a mother has to remain in a small tent
placed at a little distance from the others during a month or
five weeks;<a id="FNanchor_3036_3036" href="#Footnote_3036_3036" class="fnanchor">3036</a> and similar customs are found among many
other peoples.<a id="FNanchor_3037_3037" href="#Footnote_3037_3037" class="fnanchor">3037</a> Very commonly, in a state of savage and
barbarous life, the husband must not cohabit with his wife
till the child is weaned.<a id="FNanchor_3038_3038" href="#Footnote_3038_3038" class="fnanchor">3038</a> And this prohibition is all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
more severe, as the suckling-time generally lasts for two, three,
four years, or even more. In Sierra Leone, it was looked
upon as a crime of the most heinous nature if a wife cohabited
with her husband before the child was able to run
alone.<a id="FNanchor_3039_3039" href="#Footnote_3039_3039" class="fnanchor">3039</a> Among the Makonde, in Eastern Africa, says
Mr. Joseph Thomson, “when a woman bears a child, she
lives completely apart from her husband till the child is able
to speak, as otherwise it is believed that harm, if not death,
would come to the infant.”<a id="FNanchor_3040_3040" href="#Footnote_3040_3040" class="fnanchor">3040</a> In Fiji, “the relatives of a
woman take it as a public insult if any child should be born
before the customary three or four years have elapsed.”<a id="FNanchor_3041_3041" href="#Footnote_3041_3041" class="fnanchor">3041</a>
This long suckling-time is due chiefly to want of soft food
and animal milk.<a id="FNanchor_3042_3042" href="#Footnote_3042_3042" class="fnanchor">3042</a> But when milk can be obtained,<a id="FNanchor_3043_3043" href="#Footnote_3043_3043" class="fnanchor">3043</a> and
even when the people have domesticated animals able to
supply them with it,<a id="FNanchor_3044_3044" href="#Footnote_3044_3044" class="fnanchor">3044</a> this kind of food is often avoided.
The Chinese, who are a Tartar people, and must have
descended at one time from the “Land of Grass,” entirely
eschew the use of milk.<a id="FNanchor_3045_3045" href="#Footnote_3045_3045" class="fnanchor">3045</a></p>

<p>Professor Bastian suggests that it is on hygienic grounds,
though almost instinctively, that a man abstains from cohabitation
with his wife during her pregnancy, and as long
as she suckles her child.<a id="FNanchor_3046_3046" href="#Footnote_3046_3046" class="fnanchor">3046</a> But the reason seems rather to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
of a religious character. Diseases are generally attributed
by savages to the influence of some evil spirit.<a id="FNanchor_3047_3047" href="#Footnote_3047_3047" class="fnanchor">3047</a> Among
many peoples the attainment of the age of puberty is marked
by most superstitious ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_3048_3048" href="#Footnote_3048_3048" class="fnanchor">3048</a> A woman, during the
time of menstruation, is looked upon with a mystic detestation.<a id="FNanchor_3049_3049" href="#Footnote_3049_3049" class="fnanchor">3049</a>
It is therefore quite in accordance with primitive ideas
that the appearance of a new being should be connected in
some way with supernatural agencies. Among the Ashantees,
according to Mr. Reade, “when conception becomes apparent,
the girl goes through a ceremony of abuse, and is pelted down
to the sea, where she is cleansed. She is then set aside;
charms are bound on her wrists, spells are muttered over her,
and, by a wise sanitary regulation, her husband is not allowed
to cohabit with her from that time until she has finished
nursing her child.”<a id="FNanchor_3050_3050" href="#Footnote_3050_3050" class="fnanchor">3050</a> A woman in child-bed is very commonly
considered unclean.<a id="FNanchor_3051_3051" href="#Footnote_3051_3051" class="fnanchor">3051</a> In China, a man of the upper classes
does not speak to his wife within the first month after the
birth of a child, and no visitor will enter the house where she
lives.<a id="FNanchor_3052_3052" href="#Footnote_3052_3052" class="fnanchor">3052</a> According to early Aryan traditions, as v. Żmigrodzki
remarks, a witch and a woman in child-bed are persons so
intimately connected, that it is impossible to make any
distinction between them.<a id="FNanchor_3053_3053" href="#Footnote_3053_3053" class="fnanchor">3053</a></p>

<p>One of the chief causes of polygyny is the attraction which
female youth and beauty exercise upon man. Several
instances have already been mentioned of a fresh wife being
taken when the first wife grows old. Indeed, when a man,
soon after he has attained manhood, marries a woman of
similar age—not to speak of such countries as China and Corea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
where the first wife is generally a woman from three to eight
years older than her husband<a id="FNanchor_3054_3054" href="#Footnote_3054_3054" class="fnanchor">3054</a>—he will still be a man in the
prime of life, when the youthful beauty of his wife has passed
away for ever. This is especially the case among peoples at
the lower stages of civilization, among whom, as a rule, women
get old much sooner than in more advanced communities.</p>

<p>Thus in California, according to Mr. Powers, women are
rather handsome in their free and untoiling youth, but after
twenty-five or thirty they break down under their heavy burdens
and become ugly.<a id="FNanchor_3055_3055" href="#Footnote_3055_3055" class="fnanchor">3055</a> Among the Mandans, the beauty of the
women vanishes soon after marriage.<a id="FNanchor_3056_3056" href="#Footnote_3056_3056" class="fnanchor">3056</a> The Kutchin women
get “coarse and ugly as they grow old, owing to hard labour
and bad treatment.”<a id="FNanchor_3057_3057" href="#Footnote_3057_3057" class="fnanchor">3057</a> Patagonian women are said to lose
their youth at a very early age, “from exposure and hard
work;” and among the Warraus, according to Schomburgk,
“when the woman has reached her twentieth year, the flower
of her life is gone.”<a id="FNanchor_3058_3058" href="#Footnote_3058_3058" class="fnanchor">3058</a> In New Zealand, Tahiti, Hawaii, and
other islands of the South Sea, the beauty of women soon
decays—“the result,” says Mr. Angas, “of hard labour in
some cases, and in others of early intercourse with the
opposite sex, combined with their mode of living, which
rapidly destroys their youthful appearance.”<a id="FNanchor_3059_3059" href="#Footnote_3059_3059" class="fnanchor">3059</a></p>

<p>“Women of fifty in Europe,” Stavorinus observes, “look
younger and fresher than those of thirty in Batavia.”<a id="FNanchor_3060_3060" href="#Footnote_3060_3060" class="fnanchor">3060</a> At
two and twenty, Dyak beauty “has already begun to fade, and
the subsequent decay is rapid.”<a id="FNanchor_3061_3061" href="#Footnote_3061_3061" class="fnanchor">3061</a> Among the Manipuris and
Garos, the women, pretty when young, soon become “hags”;<a id="FNanchor_3062_3062" href="#Footnote_3062_3062" class="fnanchor">3062</a>
and this is true also of the Aino women in Yesso, partly, it
is said, because of the exposed life they lead as children,
partly because of the early age at which they marry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
become mothers, and partly because of the hard life they
continue to lead afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_3063_3063" href="#Footnote_3063_3063" class="fnanchor">3063</a></p>

<p>In Africa female beauty fades quickly. The Egyptian
women, from the age of about fourteen to that of eighteen or
twenty, are generally models of loveliness in body and limbs,
but, when they reach maturity, their attractions do not long
survive.<a id="FNanchor_3064_3064" href="#Footnote_3064_3064" class="fnanchor">3064</a> In Eastern Africa, according to Sir R. F. Burton,
the beauty of women is less perishable than in India and
Arabia; but even there charms are on the wane at thirty,
and, when old age comes on, the women are no exceptions to
“the hideous decrepitude of the East.”<a id="FNanchor_3065_3065" href="#Footnote_3065_3065" class="fnanchor">3065</a> Arab girls in the
Sahara preserve only till about their sixteenth year that
youthful freshness which the women of the north still possess
in the late spring of their life;<a id="FNanchor_3066_3066" href="#Footnote_3066_3066" class="fnanchor">3066</a> and, among the Ba-kwileh,
women have no trace of beauty after twenty-five.<a id="FNanchor_3067_3067" href="#Footnote_3067_3067" class="fnanchor">3067</a> Speaking
of the Wolofs, Mr. Reade remarks that the girls are very
pretty with their soft and glossy black skin, but, “when the
first jet of youth is passed, the skin turns to a dirty yellow
and creases like old leather; their eyes sink into the skull,
and the breasts hang down like the udder of a cow, or shrivel
up like a bladder that has burst.”<a id="FNanchor_3068_3068" href="#Footnote_3068_3068" class="fnanchor">3068</a> Among the Damaras,
Ovambo, and Kafirs, women, soon after maturity, begin to
wither, as we are told, on account of hard labour;<a id="FNanchor_3069_3069" href="#Footnote_3069_3069" class="fnanchor">3069</a> and the
Bushman women, it is said, soon become sterile from the
same cause.<a id="FNanchor_3070_3070" href="#Footnote_3070_3070" class="fnanchor">3070</a> Among the Fulah, it is rare for a woman
older than twenty to become a mother; and in Unyoro
Emin Pasha never saw a woman above twenty-five with
babies.<a id="FNanchor_3071_3071" href="#Footnote_3071_3071" class="fnanchor">3071</a></p>

<p>Early intercourse with the opposite sex is adduced by
several writers as the cause of the short prime of savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
women. But I am disposed to think that physical exertion
has a much greater influence. Even from a physiological
point of view hard labour seems to shorten female youth.
Statistics show that, among the poorer women of Berlin,
menstruation ceases at a rather earlier age than among the
well-off classes.<a id="FNanchor_3072_3072" href="#Footnote_3072_3072" class="fnanchor">3072</a> It has been suggested that in hot countries
women lose their beauty much sooner than in colder
regions,<a id="FNanchor_3073_3073" href="#Footnote_3073_3073" class="fnanchor">3073</a> whereas men are not affected in the same way by
climate. But, so far as I know, we are still in want of exact
information on this point.</p>

<p>A further cause of polygyny is man’s taste for variety.
Merolla da Sorrento asserts that the Negroes of Angola, who
used to exchange their wives with each other for a certain
time, excused themselves, when reproved, on the ground that
“they were not able to eat always of the same dish.”<a id="FNanchor_3074_3074" href="#Footnote_3074_3074" class="fnanchor">3074</a> And
in Egypt, according to Mr. Lane, “fickle passion is the most
evident and common motive both to polygamy and repeated
divorces.”<a id="FNanchor_3075_3075" href="#Footnote_3075_3075" class="fnanchor">3075</a></p>

<p>Motives due to man’s passions are not, however, the only
causes of polygyny. We must also take into account his
desire for offspring, wealth, and authority.</p>

<p>The barrenness of a wife is a very common reason for the
choice of another partner. Among the Greenlanders, for
instance, who considered it a great disgrace for a man to
have no children, particularly no sons, a husband generally
took a second wife, if the first one could not satisfy his desire
for offspring.<a id="FNanchor_3076_3076" href="#Footnote_3076_3076" class="fnanchor">3076</a> Among the Botis of Ladakh, says Lieutenant
Cunningham, “should a wife prove barren, a second can be
chosen, or should she have daughters only, a second can be
chosen similarly.”<a id="FNanchor_3077_3077" href="#Footnote_3077_3077" class="fnanchor">3077</a> In the Mutsa tribe of Indo-China, polygyny
is allowed only if the wife is sterile;<a id="FNanchor_3078_3078" href="#Footnote_3078_3078" class="fnanchor">3078</a> and, among the
Patuah or Juanga, the Eskimo at Prince Regent’s Bay, and
several other peoples, already referred to, a man scarcely ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
takes a second wife if the first wife gives him children.<a id="FNanchor_3079_3079" href="#Footnote_3079_3079" class="fnanchor">3079</a>
Among the Tuski, “if a man’s wife bears only girls, he takes
another until he obtains a boy, but no more.”<a id="FNanchor_3080_3080" href="#Footnote_3080_3080" class="fnanchor">3080</a> In China and
Tonquin, and among the Munda Kols of Chota Nagpore, it
sometimes happens that the barren wife herself advises her
husband to take a fresh partner,<a id="FNanchor_3081_3081" href="#Footnote_3081_3081" class="fnanchor">3081</a> as Rachel gave Jacob
Bilhah.<a id="FNanchor_3082_3082" href="#Footnote_3082_3082" class="fnanchor">3082</a></p>

<p>The polygyny of the ancient Hindus seems to have been
due chiefly to the fact that men dreaded the idea of dying
childless, and M. Le Play observes that even now in the East
the desire for offspring is one of the principal causes of polygyny.<a id="FNanchor_3083_3083" href="#Footnote_3083_3083" class="fnanchor">3083</a>
Dr. Gray makes the same remark as to the Chinese,<a id="FNanchor_3084_3084" href="#Footnote_3084_3084" class="fnanchor">3084</a>
Herr Andree as to the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_3085_3085" href="#Footnote_3085_3085" class="fnanchor">3085</a> In Egypt, says Mr. Lane, “a
man having a wife who has the misfortune to be barren, and
being too much attached to her to divorce her, is sometimes
induced to take a second wife, merely in the hope of obtaining
offspring.”<a id="FNanchor_3086_3086" href="#Footnote_3086_3086" class="fnanchor">3086</a></p>

<p>The more wives, the more children; and the more children,
the greater power. Man in a savage and barbarous state is
proud of a large progeny, and he who has most kinsfolk is
most honoured and feared.<a id="FNanchor_3087_3087" href="#Footnote_3087_3087" class="fnanchor">3087</a> Regarding certain Indians of
North America, among whom the dignity of chief was
elective, Heriot remarks that “the choice usually fell upon
him who had the most numerous offspring, and who was
therefore considered as the person most deeply interested
in the welfare of the tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_3088_3088" href="#Footnote_3088_3088" class="fnanchor">3088</a> Among the Chippewas, says
Mr. Keating,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span> “the pride and honour of parents depend upon
the extent of their family.”<a id="FNanchor_3089_3089" href="#Footnote_3089_3089" class="fnanchor">3089</a> Speaking of African polygyny,
Sir R. F. Burton observes that the “culture of the marriage
tie is necessary among savages and barbarians, where, unlike
Europe, a man’s relations and connections are his only
friends; besides which, a multitude of wives ministers to his
pride and influence, state and pleasure.”<a id="FNanchor_3090_3090" href="#Footnote_3090_3090" class="fnanchor">3090</a> Bosman tells us of
a viceroy tributary to the negro king of Fida, who, assisted
only by his sons and grandsons with their slaves, repulsed a
powerful enemy who came against him. This viceroy, with
his sons and grandsons, could make out the number of two
thousand descendants, not reckoning daughters or any that
were dead.<a id="FNanchor_3091_3091" href="#Footnote_3091_3091" class="fnanchor">3091</a> Moreover, in a state of nature, next to a man’s
wives, the real servant, the only one to be counted upon, is the
child.<a id="FNanchor_3092_3092" href="#Footnote_3092_3092" class="fnanchor">3092</a></p>

<p>A husband’s desire for children often leads to polygyny in
countries where the fecundity of women is at a low rate.
More than a hundred years ago, Dr. Hewit observed that
women are naturally less prolific among rude than among
polished nations.<a id="FNanchor_3093_3093" href="#Footnote_3093_3093" class="fnanchor">3093</a> This assertion, though not true universally,<a id="FNanchor_3094_3094" href="#Footnote_3094_3094" class="fnanchor">3094</a>
is probably true in the main. “It is a very rare occurrence
for an Indian woman,” says Mr. Catlin, “to be ‘blessed’ with
more than four or five children during her life; and, generally
speaking, they seem contented with two or three.”<a id="FNanchor_3095_3095" href="#Footnote_3095_3095" class="fnanchor">3095</a>
This statement is confirmed by the evidence of several other
authorities;<a id="FNanchor_3096_3096" href="#Footnote_3096_3096" class="fnanchor">3096</a> and it holds good not only for the North Ameri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>can
Indians, but, upon the whole, for a great many uncivilized
peoples.<a id="FNanchor_3097_3097" href="#Footnote_3097_3097" class="fnanchor">3097</a> Some writers ascribe this slight degree of prolificness
to hard labour,<a id="FNanchor_3098_3098" href="#Footnote_3098_3098" class="fnanchor">3098</a> or to unfavourable conditions of life
in general.<a id="FNanchor_3099_3099" href="#Footnote_3099_3099" class="fnanchor">3099</a> That it is partly due to the long period of
suckling is highly probable, not only because a woman less
easily becomes pregnant during the time of lactation, but also
on account of the continence in which she often has to live
during that period. The mortality of children is very great
among savages,<a id="FNanchor_3100_3100" href="#Footnote_3100_3100" class="fnanchor">3100</a> and this, co-operating with other causes to
keep the family small, makes polygyny seem to many peoples
absolutely necessary. Speaking of the Equatorial Africans,
Mr. Reade says, “Propagation is a perfect struggle; polygamy
becomes a law of nature; and even with the aid of this institution,
so favourable to reproduction, there are fewer children
than wives.”<a id="FNanchor_3101_3101" href="#Footnote_3101_3101" class="fnanchor">3101</a></p>

<p>A man’s fortune is increased by a multitude of wives not
only through their children, but through their labour. An
Eastern Central African, says Mr. Macdonald, finds no difficulty
in supporting even hundreds of wives. “The more
wives he has, the richer he is. It is his wives that maintain
him. They do all his ploughing, milling, cooking, &amp;c. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
may be viewed as superior servants who combine all the
capacities of male servants and female servants in Britain—who
do all his work and ask no wages.”<a id="FNanchor_3102_3102" href="#Footnote_3102_3102" class="fnanchor">3102</a> Manual labour
among savages is undertaken chiefly by women; and, as
there are no day-labourers or persons who will work for hire,
it becomes necessary for any one who requires many servants
to have many wives. Mr. Wood remarks that, when an
Indian can purchase four or five wives, their labour in the
field is worth even more to the household than his exertions
in hunting.<a id="FNanchor_3103_3103" href="#Footnote_3103_3103" class="fnanchor">3103</a> “The object of the Kutchin,” says Mr. Kirby,
“is to have a greater number of poor creatures whom he can
use as beasts of burden for hauling his wood, carrying his
meat, and performing the drudgery of his camp.”<a id="FNanchor_3104_3104" href="#Footnote_3104_3104" class="fnanchor">3104</a> A Modok
defends his having several wives on the plea that he requires
one to keep house, another to hunt, another to dig roots.<a id="FNanchor_3105_3105" href="#Footnote_3105_3105" class="fnanchor">3105</a> In
the Solomon Islands in New Guinea, at the Gold Coast, and in
other places where the women cultivate the ground, a plurality
of wives implies a rich supply of food;<a id="FNanchor_3106_3106" href="#Footnote_3106_3106" class="fnanchor">3106</a> whilst, among the
Tartars, according to Marco Polo, wives were of use to their
husbands as traders.<a id="FNanchor_3107_3107" href="#Footnote_3107_3107" class="fnanchor">3107</a></p>

<p>A multitude of wives increases a man’s authority, not only
because it increases his fortune and the number of his children,
or because it makes him able to be liberal and keep open
doors for foreigners and guests,<a id="FNanchor_3108_3108" href="#Footnote_3108_3108" class="fnanchor">3108</a> but also because it presupposes
a certain superiority in personal capabilities, wealth, or
rank. Statements such as “a man’s greatness is ever proportionate
to the number of his wives,” or “polygamy is held
to be the test of his wealth and consequence,” are very
frequently met with in books of travels. Thus the Apache
“who can support or keep, or attract by his power to keep, the
greatest number of women, is the man who is deemed entitled
to the greatest amount of honour and respect.”<a id="FNanchor_3109_3109" href="#Footnote_3109_3109" class="fnanchor">3109</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span></p>

<p>However desirable polygyny may be from man’s point of
view, it is, as we have seen, altogether prohibited among many
peoples, and, in countries where it is an established institution,
it is practised, as a rule to which there are few exceptions,
only by a comparatively small class. The proportion between
the sexes partly accounts for this. But there are other causes
of no less importance.</p>

<p>In ethnographical descriptions it is very often stated that a
man takes as many wives as he is able to maintain. Where
the amount of female labour is limited, where life is supported
by hunting, where agriculture is unknown, and no accumulated
property worth mentioning exists, it may be extremely
difficult for a man to keep a plurality of wives. Among the
Patagonians, for instance, it is chiefly those who possess some
property who take more than one wife.<a id="FNanchor_3110_3110" href="#Footnote_3110_3110" class="fnanchor">3110</a> Regarding the
Tuski, Mr. Hooper states that “each man has as many wives
as he can afford to keep, the question of food being the
greatest consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_3111_3111" href="#Footnote_3111_3111" class="fnanchor">3111</a> In Oonalashka, according to
v. Langsdorf, a man who had many wives, if his means decreased,
sent first one, then another back to their parents.<a id="FNanchor_3112_3112" href="#Footnote_3112_3112" class="fnanchor">3112</a></p>

<p>Again, where female labour is of considerable value, the
necessity of paying the purchase-sum for a wife very often
makes the poorer people content with monogamy. Thus
among the Zulus, Mr. Eyles writes, many men have but one
wife because cattle have to be paid for women. Among the
Gonds and Korkús, according to Mr. Forsyth, “polygamy is
not forbidden, but, women being costly chattels, it is rarely
practised.”<a id="FNanchor_3113_3113" href="#Footnote_3113_3113" class="fnanchor">3113</a> Among the Bechuanas, says Andersson, there is
no limit, but his means of purchase, to the number of wives
a man may possess.<a id="FNanchor_3114_3114" href="#Footnote_3114_3114" class="fnanchor">3114</a> And the same is observed with reference
to a great many other peoples, especially in Africa, where
the woman-trade is at its height. Polygyny is, moreover,
checked to some extent by the man’s obligation to serve for
his wife for a certain number of years, and even more by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
having to settle down with his father-in-law for the whole of
his life.</p>

<p>So far as the woman is allowed to choose, she prefers, other
things being equal, the man who is best able to support her,
or the man of the greatest wealth or highest position.
Naturally, therefore, wherever polygyny prevails, it is the
principal men—whether they owe their position to birth,
skill, or acquired wealth—who have the largest number of
wives; or it may be that they alone have more than one wife.
Speaking of the Ainos of Yesso, Commander H. C. St. John
says that a successful or expert hunter or fisher sometimes
keeps two wives; and, if a woman finds her husband an unsuccessful
Nimrod, she abandons him.<a id="FNanchor_3115_3115" href="#Footnote_3115_3115" class="fnanchor">3115</a> Among the Aleuts,
“the number of wives was not limited, except that the best
hunters had the greatest number.”<a id="FNanchor_3116_3116" href="#Footnote_3116_3116" class="fnanchor">3116</a> Among the Kutchin,
“polygamy is practised generally in proportion to the rank
and wealth of the man;”<a id="FNanchor_3117_3117" href="#Footnote_3117_3117" class="fnanchor">3117</a> and, among the Brazilian aborigines
and the Araucanians, polygyny occurs only or chiefly among
rich men and chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_3118_3118" href="#Footnote_3118_3118" class="fnanchor">3118</a> Touching the Equatorial Africans,
Mr. Reade remarks, “The bush-man can generally afford but
one wife, who must find him his daily bread.... But
the rich man can indulge in the institutions of polygamy and
domestic slavery.”<a id="FNanchor_3119_3119" href="#Footnote_3119_3119" class="fnanchor">3119</a> In Dahomey, as we are told, “the king
has thousands of wives, the nobles hundreds, others tens;
while the soldier is unable to support one.”<a id="FNanchor_3120_3120" href="#Footnote_3120_3120" class="fnanchor">3120</a> In the New
Hebrides, polygyny prevails especially among the chiefs; in
Naiabui of New Guinea, “the head men only have more
than two or three wives;” and, in South Australia, “the old
men secure the greatest number.”<a id="FNanchor_3121_3121" href="#Footnote_3121_3121" class="fnanchor">3121</a></p>

<p>Thus polygyny has come to be associated with greatness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
and is therefore, as Mr. Spencer remarks, thought praiseworthy,
while monogamy, as associated with poverty, is
thought mean.<a id="FNanchor_3122_3122" href="#Footnote_3122_3122" class="fnanchor">3122</a> Indeed, plurality of wives has everywhere
tended to become a more or less definite class distinction, the
luxury being permitted, among some peoples, only to chiefs
or nobles.</p>

<p>One of the most important of the influences which determine
the form of marriage is the position of women, or rather
the respect in which they are held by men. For polygyny
implies a violation of woman’s feelings.</p>

<p>Several statements tend to show that jealousy and rivalry
do not always disturb the peace in polygynous families. It
sometimes happens that the first wife herself brings her husband
a fresh wife or a concubine, or advises him to take one,
when she becomes old herself, or if she proves barren, or has
a suckling child, or for some other reason.<a id="FNanchor_3123_3123" href="#Footnote_3123_3123" class="fnanchor">3123</a> In Equatorial
Africa, according to Mr. Reade, the women are the stoutest
supporters of polygyny:—“If a man marries,” he says, “and
his wife thinks that he can afford another spouse, she pesters
him to marry again, and calls him ‘a stingy fellow’ if he declines
to do so.”<a id="FNanchor_3124_3124" href="#Footnote_3124_3124" class="fnanchor">3124</a> Speaking of the Makalolo women, Livingstone
observes, “On hearing that a man in England could
marry but one wife, several ladies exclaimed that they would
not like to live in such a country: they could not imagine
how English ladies could relish our custom, for, in their way
of thinking, every man of respectability should have a number
of wives, as a proof of his wealth. Similar ideas prevail all
down the Zambesi.”<a id="FNanchor_3125_3125" href="#Footnote_3125_3125" class="fnanchor">3125</a> Among the Californian Modok also,
according to the Hon. A. B. Meacham, the women are
opposed to any change in the polygynous habits of the men.<a id="FNanchor_3126_3126" href="#Footnote_3126_3126" class="fnanchor">3126</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
But such statements may easily be misinterpreted. Often
the wives live peacefully together only in consequence of the
strict discipline of the husband.<a id="FNanchor_3127_3127" href="#Footnote_3127_3127" class="fnanchor">3127</a> They put up with polygyny,
thanks to long custom; they even approve of it where it
procures them advantages. The consideration of the whole
family, and especially of the first wife, is increased by every
new marriage the husband concludes.<a id="FNanchor_3128_3128" href="#Footnote_3128_3128" class="fnanchor">3128</a> Where the wife is
her husband’s slave, polygyny implies a greater division of
labour. This is the reason why, among the Apaches, the
women do not object to it; why, among the Bagobos of the
Philippines, they rejoice at the arrival of a new wife; why, in
the Mohammedan East, they themselves encourage the husband
to marry more wives.<a id="FNanchor_3129_3129" href="#Footnote_3129_3129" class="fnanchor">3129</a> Among the Arabs of Upper
Egypt, says Baker, one of the conditions of accepting a suitor
is, that a female slave is to be provided for the special use of
the wife, although the slaves of the establishment occupy, at
the same time, the position of concubines.<a id="FNanchor_3130_3130" href="#Footnote_3130_3130" class="fnanchor">3130</a> Von Weber
tells us of a Kafir woman who, on account of her heavy
labour, passionately urged her husband to take another
wife.<a id="FNanchor_3131_3131" href="#Footnote_3131_3131" class="fnanchor">3131</a> Nevertheless, polygyny is an offence against the feelings
of women, not only among highly civilized peoples, but
even among the rudest savages. For jealousy is not exclusively
a masculine passion, although it is generally more
powerful in men than in women.<a id="FNanchor_3132_3132" href="#Footnote_3132_3132" class="fnanchor">3132</a></p>

<p>The Greenlanders have a saying that “whales, musk-oxen,
and reindeer deserted the country because the women
were jealous at the conduct of their husbands.”<a id="FNanchor_3133_3133" href="#Footnote_3133_3133" class="fnanchor">3133</a> Regarding
the Northern Indians, Hearne says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span> “The men are in general
very jealous of their wives, and I make no doubt but the
same spirit reigns among the women, but they are kept so
much in awe of their husbands, that the liberty of thinking is
the greatest privilege they enjoy.”<a id="FNanchor_3134_3134" href="#Footnote_3134_3134" class="fnanchor">3134</a> Franklin tells us of an
Indian woman who committed suicide by hanging herself, in
a fit of jealousy; and another woman threw herself into the
Mississippi with her child, when her husband took a new
wife.<a id="FNanchor_3135_3135" href="#Footnote_3135_3135" class="fnanchor">3135</a> As regards the Dacotahs, Mr. Prescott says that
“polygamy is the cause of a great deal of their miseries and
troubles. The women, most of them, abhor the practice, but
are overruled by the men. Some of the women commit
suicide on this account.”<a id="FNanchor_3136_3136" href="#Footnote_3136_3136" class="fnanchor">3136</a> The natives of Guiana, according
to the Rev. W. H. Brett, live in comfort, as long as the man
is content with one wife, but, when he takes another, “the
natural feelings of woman rebel at such cruel treatment, and
jealousy and unhappiness have, in repeated instances, led to
suicide.”<a id="FNanchor_3137_3137" href="#Footnote_3137_3137" class="fnanchor">3137</a> Among the Tamanacs, says v. Humboldt, “the
husband calls the second and third wife the ‘companions’ of
the first; and the first treats these ‘companions’ as rivals and
‘enemies’ (‘ipucjatoje’).”<a id="FNanchor_3138_3138" href="#Footnote_3138_3138" class="fnanchor">3138</a> Among the Charruas, it often
happens that a woman abandons her husband if he has a
plurality of wives, as soon as she is able to find another man
who will take her as his only wife.<a id="FNanchor_3139_3139" href="#Footnote_3139_3139" class="fnanchor">3139</a> And, when a Fuegian
has as many as four women, his hut is every day transformed
into a field of battle, and many a young and pretty wife must
even atone with her life for the precedence given her by the
common husband.<a id="FNanchor_3140_3140" href="#Footnote_3140_3140" class="fnanchor">3140</a></p>

<p>In the islands of the Pacific similar scenes occur. The
missionary Williams’s wife once asked a Fiji woman who
was <i>minus</i> her nose, “How is it that so many of your women
are without a nose?” “It is due to a plurality of wives,” was
the answer; “jealousy causes hatred, and then the stronger
tries to cut or bite off the nose of the one she hates.”<a id="FNanchor_3141_3141" href="#Footnote_3141_3141" class="fnanchor">3141</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
Tukopia, many a wife who believed another woman to be
preferred by the husband committed suicide.<a id="FNanchor_3142_3142" href="#Footnote_3142_3142" class="fnanchor">3142</a> Among the
Australian aborigines, the old wives are extremely jealous of
their younger rivals, so that “a new woman would always be
beaten by the other wife, and a good deal would depend on
the fighting powers of the former whether she kept her position
or not.”<a id="FNanchor_3143_3143" href="#Footnote_3143_3143" class="fnanchor">3143</a> Among the Narrinyeri, according to the Rev.
A. Meyer, the several wives of one man very seldom agree
well with each other; they are continually quarrelling, each
endeavouring to be the favourite.<a id="FNanchor_3144_3144" href="#Footnote_3144_3144" class="fnanchor">3144</a> “The black women,” says
Herr Lumholtz, “are also capable of being jealous.”<a id="FNanchor_3145_3145" href="#Footnote_3145_3145" class="fnanchor">3145</a></p>

<p>Among the Sea Dyaks, according to Sir Spenser St. John,
the wife is much more jealous of her husband than he is of
her.<a id="FNanchor_3146_3146" href="#Footnote_3146_3146" class="fnanchor">3146</a> In China, many women dislike the idea of getting
married, as they fear that, should their husbands become
polygynists, there would remain for them a life of unhappiness.
Hence, some become Buddhist or Taouist nuns, and others
prefer death by suicide to marriage.<a id="FNanchor_3147_3147" href="#Footnote_3147_3147" class="fnanchor">3147</a> Mr. Balfour asserts
that, among the Mohammedans and ruling Hindu races who
permit and practise polygyny, it causes much intriguing and
disquiet in homes.<a id="FNanchor_3148_3148" href="#Footnote_3148_3148" class="fnanchor">3148</a> According to Mr. Tod, it “is the fertile
source of evil, moral as well as physical, in the East.”<a id="FNanchor_3149_3149" href="#Footnote_3149_3149" class="fnanchor">3149</a> The
same view is taken by Pischon and d’Escayrac de Lauture
with regard to the polygyny of the Mohammedans.<a id="FNanchor_3150_3150" href="#Footnote_3150_3150" class="fnanchor">3150</a> In
Persia, says Dr. Polak, a married woman cannot feel a greater
pain than if her husband takes a fresh wife, whom he prefers
to her; then she is quite disconsolate.<a id="FNanchor_3151_3151" href="#Footnote_3151_3151" class="fnanchor">3151</a> In Egypt, quarrels
between the various women belonging to the same man are
very frequent, and often the wife will not even allow her
female slave or slaves to appear unveiled in the presence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
her husband.<a id="FNanchor_3152_3152" href="#Footnote_3152_3152" class="fnanchor">3152</a> In the description, in the Book of Proverbs,
of domestic happiness, it is assumed that the husband has
only one wife;<a id="FNanchor_3153_3153" href="#Footnote_3153_3153" class="fnanchor">3153</a> and, in the latter part of the ‘Rig-Veda,’
there are hymns in which wives curse their fellow-wives.<a id="FNanchor_3154_3154" href="#Footnote_3154_3154" class="fnanchor">3154</a></p>

<p>The Abyssinian women are described as very jealous; and
in the polygynous families of the Eastern Africans, Zulus,
Basutos, &amp;c., quarrels frequently arise.<a id="FNanchor_3155_3155" href="#Footnote_3155_3155" class="fnanchor">3155</a> The Hova word for
polygyny is derived from the root “ràfy,” which means “an
adversary.” “So invariably,” says the Rev. J. Sibree, “has
the taking of more wives than one shown itself to be a fruitful
cause of enmity and strife in a household, that this word,
which means ‘the making an adversary,’ is the term always
applied to it.... The different wives are always trying to get
an advantage over each other, and to wheedle their husband
out of his property; constant quarrels and jealousy are the
result, and polygamy becomes inevitably the causing of
strife, ‘the making an adversary.’”<a id="FNanchor_3156_3156" href="#Footnote_3156_3156" class="fnanchor">3156</a> Statements of this kind
cannot but shake our confidence in the optimistic assertions
of Dr. Le Bon and other defenders of polygyny.<a id="FNanchor_3157_3157" href="#Footnote_3157_3157" class="fnanchor">3157</a></p>

<p>In order to prevent quarrels and fights between the wives,
the husband frequently gives each of them a separate house.
It is probably in part for the same reason that, among several
peoples, wives are usually chosen from one family. In general,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
says Domenech, when an Indian wishes to have many wives,
he chooses before all others, if he can, sisters, because he thinks
he can thus secure more domestic peace.<a id="FNanchor_3158_3158" href="#Footnote_3158_3158" class="fnanchor">3158</a> This is true of
many of the North American aborigines;<a id="FNanchor_3159_3159" href="#Footnote_3159_3159" class="fnanchor">3159</a> a man who marries
the eldest daughter of a family secures in many cases the
right to marry all her sisters as soon as they are old enough
to become his wives.<a id="FNanchor_3160_3160" href="#Footnote_3160_3160" class="fnanchor">3160</a> The same practice is said to prevail in
Madagascar,<a id="FNanchor_3161_3161" href="#Footnote_3161_3161" class="fnanchor">3161</a> and, combined with polyandry, among certain
peoples of India. But it is obvious that the evils of polygyny
are not removed by such arrangements.</p>

<p>Where women have succeeded in obtaining some power
over their husbands, or where the altruistic feelings of men have
become refined enough to lead them to respect the feelings of
those weaker than themselves, monogamy is generally considered
the only proper form of marriage. Among monogamous
savage or barbarous races the position of women is comparatively
good; and the one phenomenon must be regarded
as partly the cause, partly the effect of the other. The purely
monogamous Iroquois, to quote Schoolcraft, are “the only tribes
in America, north and south, so far as we have any accounts,
who gave to woman a conservative power in their political
deliberations. The Iroquois matrons had their representative
in the public councils; and they exercised a negative, or what
we call a veto power, in the important question of the declaration
of war. They had the right also to interpose in bringing
about a peace.”<a id="FNanchor_3162_3162" href="#Footnote_3162_3162" class="fnanchor">3162</a> Moreover, they had considerable privileges
in the family.<a id="FNanchor_3163_3163" href="#Footnote_3163_3163" class="fnanchor">3163</a> Among the Nicaraguans—a people almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
wholly monogamous,—the husbands are said to have been so
much under the control of their wives that they were obliged
to do the housework, while the women attended to the
trading.<a id="FNanchor_3164_3164" href="#Footnote_3164_3164" class="fnanchor">3164</a> Among the Zapotecs and other nations inhabiting
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, who do not permit polygyny,
“gentleness, affection, and frugality characterize the marital
relations.”<a id="FNanchor_3165_3165" href="#Footnote_3165_3165" class="fnanchor">3165</a> In New Hanover<a id="FNanchor_3166_3166" href="#Footnote_3166_3166" class="fnanchor">3166</a> and among the Dyaks,<a id="FNanchor_3167_3167" href="#Footnote_3167_3167" class="fnanchor">3167</a> the
wife seems to have a kind of authority; and among the
Minahassers, according to Dr. Hickson, “the woman is, and
probably has been for many generations, on a footing of
equality with her husband.”<a id="FNanchor_3168_3168" href="#Footnote_3168_3168" class="fnanchor">3168</a> Mr. Man states that, in the
Andaman Islands, “the consideration and respect with which
women are treated might with advantage be emulated by
certain classes in our own land.”<a id="FNanchor_3169_3169" href="#Footnote_3169_3169" class="fnanchor">3169</a> The Pádam wives are
treated by their husbands with a regard that seems singular
in so rude a race. “But I have seen,” says Colonel Dalton,
“other races as rude who in this respect are an example to
more civilized people. It is because with these rude people
the inclination of the persons most interested in the marriage
is consulted, and polygamy is not practised.”<a id="FNanchor_3170_3170" href="#Footnote_3170_3170" class="fnanchor">3170</a> The Munda
Kols of Chota Nagpore call a wife “the mistress of the
house,” and she takes up a position similar to that of a
married woman in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_3171_3171" href="#Footnote_3171_3171" class="fnanchor">3171</a> The Santal women, who enjoy
the advantage of reigning alone in the husband’s wigwam,
according to Mr. E. G. Man, hold a much higher <i>status</i> in the
family circle than their less fortunate sisters in most Eastern
countries.<a id="FNanchor_3172_3172" href="#Footnote_3172_3172" class="fnanchor">3172</a> The Kandhs, Bodo, and Dhimáls treat their wives
and daughters with confidence and kindness, and consult them
in all domestic concerns.<a id="FNanchor_3173_3173" href="#Footnote_3173_3173" class="fnanchor">3173</a> Among the monogamous Moors
of the Western Soudan, the women exercise a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
influence on the men, who take the greatest pains to pay them
homage.<a id="FNanchor_3174_3174" href="#Footnote_3174_3174" class="fnanchor">3174</a> The Touareg wives’ authority is so great that,
although Islam permits polygyny, the men are forced to live
in monogamy.<a id="FNanchor_3175_3175" href="#Footnote_3175_3175" class="fnanchor">3175</a> Among the monogamous Tedâ, the women
hold a very high position in the family.<a id="FNanchor_3176_3176" href="#Footnote_3176_3176" class="fnanchor">3176</a> As for European
monogamy, there can be no doubt that it owes its origin
chiefly to the consideration of men for the feelings of women.</p>

<p>The form of marriage is, further, influenced by the quality
of the passions which unites the sexes. When love depends
entirely on external attractions, it is necessarily fickle; but
when it implies sympathy arising from mental qualities, there
is a tie between husband and wife which lasts long after youth
and beauty are gone.</p>

<p>It remains for us to note the true monogamous instinct, the
absorbing passion for one, as a powerful obstacle to polygyny.
“The sociable interest,” Professor Bain remarks, “is by its
nature diffused: even the maternal feeling admits of plurality
of objects; revenge does not desire to have but one victim;
the love of domination needs many subjects; but the greatest
intensity of love limits the regards to one.”<a id="FNanchor_3177_3177" href="#Footnote_3177_3177" class="fnanchor">3177</a> The beloved
person acquires, in the imagination of the lover, an immeasurable
superiority over all others. “The beginnings of a special
affection,” the same psychologist says, “turn upon a small
difference of liking; but such differences are easily exaggerated;
the feeling and the estimate acting and re-acting,
till the distinction becomes altogether transcendent.”<a id="FNanchor_3178_3178" href="#Footnote_3178_3178" class="fnanchor">3178</a> This
absorbing passion for one is not confined to the members of
civilized societies. It is found also among savage peoples, and
even among some of the lower animals. Hermann Müller,
Brehm, and other good observers have proved that it is
experienced by birds; and Mr. Darwin found it among
certain domesticated mammals.<a id="FNanchor_3179_3179" href="#Footnote_3179_3179" class="fnanchor">3179</a> The love-bird rarely survives
the death of its companion, even when supplied with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
fresh and suitable mate.<a id="FNanchor_3180_3180" href="#Footnote_3180_3180" class="fnanchor">3180</a> M. Houzeau states, on the authority
of Frédéric Cuvier, “Lorsque l’un des ouistitis (<i>Harpale
jacchus</i>) du Jardin des Plantes de Paris vint à mourir
l’époux survivant fut inconsolable. Il caressa longtemps le
cadavre de sa compagne; et quand à la fin il fut convaincu de
la triste réalité, il se mit les mains sur les yeux, et resta sans
bouger et sans prendre de nourriture, jusqu’à ce qu’il eût lui-même
succombé.”<a id="FNanchor_3181_3181" href="#Footnote_3181_3181" class="fnanchor">3181</a></p>

<p>Among the Indians of Western Washington and North-Western
Oregon, says Dr. Gibbs, “a strong sensual attachment
undoubtedly often exists, which leads to marriage, as instances
are not rare of young women destroying themselves on the
death of a lover.”<a id="FNanchor_3182_3182" href="#Footnote_3182_3182" class="fnanchor">3182</a> The like is said of other Indian tribes, in
which suicide from unsuccessful love has sometimes occurred

<p>As a man, under certain circumstances, desires many wives,
so a woman may have several reasons for desiring a plurality
of husbands. But the jealousy of man does not readily suffer
any rivals, and, as he is the stronger, his will is decisive.
Hence, where polyandry occurs, it is only exceptionally a
result of the woman’s wishes.</p>

<p>Various causes have been adduced for this revolting prac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>tice.
The difficulty of raising the sum for a wife, and the expense
of maintaining women may perhaps in part account for
it.<a id="FNanchor_3188_3188" href="#Footnote_3188_3188" class="fnanchor">3188</a> Regarding polyandry in Kunawar, the Rev. W. Rebsch
says that the cause assigned is not poverty, but a desire to
keep the common patrimony from being distributed among
a number of brothers.<a id="FNanchor_3189_3189" href="#Footnote_3189_3189" class="fnanchor">3189</a> Some writers believe that polyandry
subserves the useful end of preventing the woman from being
exposed to danger and difficulty, when she is left alone in her
remote home during the prolonged absences of her lord.<a id="FNanchor_3190_3190" href="#Footnote_3190_3190" class="fnanchor">3190</a>
According to the Sinhalese, the practice originated in the so-called
feudal times, when the enforced attendance of the
people on the king and the higher chiefs would have led to the
ruin of the rice lands, had not some interested party been left
to look after the tillage. But Sir Emerson Tennent remarks
that polyandry is much more ancient than the system thus
indicated: it is shown to have existed at a period long antecedent
to “feudalism.”<a id="FNanchor_3191_3191" href="#Footnote_3191_3191" class="fnanchor">3191</a> To whatever other causes the
practice may be attributed, the chief immediate cause is, no
doubt, a numerical disproportion between the sexes.</p>

<small>THE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Concluded</i>)</p>


<p>As to the history of the forms of human marriage, two
inferences regarding monogamy and polygyny may be made
with absolute certainty: monogamy, always the predominant
form of marriage, has been more prevalent at the lowest stages
of civilization than at somewhat higher stages; whilst, at a
still higher stage, polygyny has again, to a great extent,
yielded to monogamy.</p>

<p>As already said, wars, often greatly disturbing the proportion
of the sexes among peoples with a highly developed
tribal organization, exercise a much smaller influence in that
respect in societies of a ruder type. As in such societies all
men are nearly equal, and, to quote Mr. Wallace, “each man
scrupulously respects the rights of his fellow, and any infraction
of those rights rarely or never takes place,”<a id="FNanchor_3192_3192" href="#Footnote_3192_3192" class="fnanchor">3192</a> no great
scope is left for polygynous habits.</p>

<p>Plurality of wives has comparatively few attractions for the
men of rude communities, where life is supported chiefly by
hunting, and female labour is of slight value. In societies of
a higher kind, the case is different. True, in such societies a
man has to buy his wife, and women are often costly chattels;
but this obstacle to polygyny is more than counterbalanced by
the accumulation of wealth and the distinction of classes.</p>

<p>Nothing, indeed, is more favourable to polygyny than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
social differentiation. “In its highest and regulated form,”
Mr. Morgan justly observes, “it presupposes a considerable
advance of society, together with the development of superior
and inferior classes, and of some kinds of wealth.”<a id="FNanchor_3193_3193" href="#Footnote_3193_3193" class="fnanchor">3193</a> Speaking
of the Iroquois, Colden long ago remarked that, “in any
nation where all are on a par as to riches and power, plurality
of wives cannot well be introduced.”<a id="FNanchor_3194_3194" href="#Footnote_3194_3194" class="fnanchor">3194</a> According to Waitz,
the reason why polygyny is very rare among the Hottentots
is, that they do not know of any disparity in rank and
wealth.<a id="FNanchor_3195_3195" href="#Footnote_3195_3195" class="fnanchor">3195</a> The Rock Veddahs have no class distinction, and,
though each party among them has a headman—the most
energetic senior of the tribe,—he exercises scarcely any
authority.<a id="FNanchor_3196_3196" href="#Footnote_3196_3196" class="fnanchor">3196</a> Almost the same may be said of most of the
monogamous savage peoples whom we have mentioned.
Thus, among the Pádams, all, except slaves, are equal in
rank;<a id="FNanchor_3197_3197" href="#Footnote_3197_3197" class="fnanchor">3197</a> and of the Kukis it is said that all eat and drink
together, and that “one man is as good as another.”<a id="FNanchor_3198_3198" href="#Footnote_3198_3198" class="fnanchor">3198</a> This
is true of the Chittagong Hill tribes in general, who
enjoy a perfect social equality, their nomadic life precluding
any great accumulation of wealth.<a id="FNanchor_3199_3199" href="#Footnote_3199_3199" class="fnanchor">3199</a> Among the Hill Dyaks,
as Mr. Spencer observes, chiefs are unable to enforce genuine
subordination; the headman of each Bodo and Dhimál
village has but nominal authority; and the governor of a
Pueblo town is annually elected.<a id="FNanchor_3200_3200" href="#Footnote_3200_3200" class="fnanchor">3200</a> In Tana, where the
authority of a chief does not seem to extend a gunshot
beyond his own dwelling, few chiefs have more than three
wives, and most of them have only one or two.<a id="FNanchor_3201_3201" href="#Footnote_3201_3201" class="fnanchor">3201</a> On the
other hand, throughout Africa, polygyny and great class
distinctions occur simultaneously. We may therefore safely
conclude that polygyny became more prevalent in proportion
as differentiation increased with the progress of civilization.</p>

<p>It is a notable fact that the higher savages and barbarians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
indulge in this practice to a greater extent than the very
lowest races. These, with few exceptions, are either strictly
monogamous, or but little addicted to polygyny. The lowest
forest tribes in Brazil and the interior of Borneo are monogamous.
Among the Veddahs and Andamanese, monogamy
is as rigidly insisted upon as anywhere in Europe. According
to Captain Lewin, the monogamous Toungtha are “unamenable
to the lures of civilization,” and he thinks it will be
found difficult, if not impossible, to wean them from their
savage life.<a id="FNanchor_3202_3202" href="#Footnote_3202_3202" class="fnanchor">3202</a> The Mrús are despised as wild men by the
polygynous Khyoungtha;<a id="FNanchor_3203_3203" href="#Footnote_3203_3203" class="fnanchor">3203</a> and the Californians, who, according
to Mr. Powers, were far less addicted to polygyny than
the Atlantic Indians, are “a humble and a lowly race, ...
one of the lowest on earth.”<a id="FNanchor_3204_3204" href="#Footnote_3204_3204" class="fnanchor">3204</a></p>

<p>Certain peoples who were originally monogamous are
known to have adopted polygyny under the influence of a
higher civilization. Thus, according to Professor Vámbéry,
there is not a single indication that polygyny was an institution
of the primitive Turco-Tartars, and even now it is
almost unknown among the nomadic peoples of that race.<a id="FNanchor_3205_3205" href="#Footnote_3205_3205" class="fnanchor">3205</a>
Dr. Mason and Mr. Smeaton state that, among the
Karens, it is occasionally practised only by those who are
brought much in contact with the Burmese.<a id="FNanchor_3206_3206" href="#Footnote_3206_3206" class="fnanchor">3206</a> Among the
Hindus, according to Mr. Dutt, polygyny seems to have
grown in the latter part of the Vedic age, as there are
scarcely any allusions to it in the earlier hymns.<a id="FNanchor_3207_3207" href="#Footnote_3207_3207" class="fnanchor">3207</a> Goguet
observes that “fables which can be traced back to the earliest
times give us no instance of any man’s having more than
one lawful wife.”<a id="FNanchor_3208_3208" href="#Footnote_3208_3208" class="fnanchor">3208</a> Although the majority of the heroes in
the writings of Kalidasa are described as polygynists,<a id="FNanchor_3209_3209" href="#Footnote_3209_3209" class="fnanchor">3209</a> the
principal divinities whom the Hindus acknowledge are repre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>sented
as married to but one legitimate wife.<a id="FNanchor_3210_3210" href="#Footnote_3210_3210" class="fnanchor">3210</a> The higher
position so generally granted to the <i>first</i> married wife in
polygynous families seems to indicate in most cases a transition
from monogamous to polygynous habits, and not <i>vice
versa</i>, as has often been suggested.<a id="FNanchor_3211_3211" href="#Footnote_3211_3211" class="fnanchor">3211</a></p>

<p>Monogamy is the more likely to have prevailed almost
exclusively among our earliest human ancestors, since it does
so among the man-like apes. Mr. Darwin certainly mentions
the Gorilla as a polygamist;<a id="FNanchor_3212_3212" href="#Footnote_3212_3212" class="fnanchor">3212</a> but the majority of statements
we have regarding this animal are to the opposite effect.
Relying on the most trustworthy authorities, Professor Hartmann
says, “The Gorilla lives in a society consisting of male
and female and their young of varying ages.”<a id="FNanchor_3213_3213" href="#Footnote_3213_3213" class="fnanchor">3213</a></p>

<p>We may thus take for granted that civilization up to a
certain point is favourable to polygyny; but it is equally
certain that in its higher forms it leads to monogamy.</p>

<p>One of the chief advantages of civilization is the decrease
of wars. The death-rate of men has consequently become
less, and the considerable disproportion between the sexes
which, among many warlike peoples, makes polygyny almost
a law of nature, no longer exists among the most advanced
nations. No superstitious belief keeps the civilized man apart
from his wife during her pregnancy and whilst she suckles her
child; and the suckling time has become much shorter since
the introduction of domesticated animals and the use of milk.
To a cultivated mind youth and beauty are by no means the
only attractions of a woman; and civilization has made
female beauty more durable. The desire for offspring as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
have seen, has become less intense. A large family, instead
of being a help in the struggle for existence, is often considered
an insufferable burden. A man’s kinsfolk are not
now his only friends, and his wealth and power do not
depend upon the number of his wives and children. A wife
has ceased to be a mere labourer, and for manual labour we
have to a great extent substituted the work of domesticated
animals and the use of implements and machines.<a id="FNanchor_3214_3214" href="#Footnote_3214_3214" class="fnanchor">3214</a> Polygyny
has thus, in many ways, become less desirable for the
civilized man than it was for his barbarian and savage
ancestors. And other causes have co-operated to produce
the same result.</p>

<p>When the feelings of women are held in due respect,
monogamy will necessarily be the only recognized form of
marriage. In no way does the progress of mankind show
itself more clearly than in the increased acknowledgment of
women’s rights, and the causes which, at lower stages of
development, may make polygyny desired by women themselves,
do not exist in highly civilized societies. The refined
feeling of love, depending chiefly upon mutual sympathy and
upon appreciation of mental qualities, is scarcely compatible
with polygynous habits; and the passion for one has
gradually become more absorbing.</p>

<p>Will monogamy be the only recognized form of marriage
in the future? This question has been answered in different
ways. According to Mr. Spencer, “the monogamic form of
the sexual relation is manifestly the ultimate form; and any
changes to be anticipated must be in the direction of
completion and extension of it.”<a id="FNanchor_3215_3215" href="#Footnote_3215_3215" class="fnanchor">3215</a> Dr. Le Bon, on the other
hand, thinks that European laws will, in the future, legalize
polygyny;<a id="FNanchor_3216_3216" href="#Footnote_3216_3216" class="fnanchor">3216</a> and M. Letourneau remarks that, although we
may now look upon monogamy as superior to any other form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
of marriage yet known, “we need not consider it the Ultima
Thule in the evolution of connubial ceremonies.”<a id="FNanchor_3217_3217" href="#Footnote_3217_3217" class="fnanchor">3217</a> But we
may without hesitation assert that, if mankind advance in the
same direction as hitherto; if, consequently, the causes to
which monogamy in the most progressive societies owes its
origin continue to operate with constantly growing force;
if, especially, altruism increases, and the feeling of love
becomes more refined, and more exclusively directed to one,—the
laws of monogamy can never be changed, but must be
followed much more strictly than they are now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. McLennan suggests that, in early times, polyandry was
the rule and monogamy and polygyny exceptions. According
to his view, the only marriage law in which female kinship
could have originated was polyandry—polyandry of “the
ruder sort,” in which the husbands are not kinsmen. And it
is, he says, impossible not to believe that the Levirate—that
is, the practice of marrying a dead brother’s widow—is
derived from polyandry.<a id="FNanchor_3218_3218" href="#Footnote_3218_3218" class="fnanchor">3218</a> The fallacy of the first inference,
which assumes the system of “kinship through females only”
to depend upon uncertainty as to fathers, has already been
shown. The second inference will be found to be equally
erroneous.</p>

<p>The Levirate is undoubtedly a wide-spread custom;<a id="FNanchor_3219_3219" href="#Footnote_3219_3219" class="fnanchor">3219</a> and, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
it could be proved to be a survival of polyandry, we should
be compelled to conclude that this form of marriage was at
one time very common. Where women are regarded as
property, they are, of course, inherited like other possessions.<a id="FNanchor_3220_3220" href="#Footnote_3220_3220" class="fnanchor">3220</a>
In many cases the brother, or, in default of a brother, the
nearest male relation, is expressly stated to be <i>entitled</i> to have
the widow; and, if he does not marry her, he has nevertheless,
the guardianship over her, and may give her away or sell her
to some other man.<a id="FNanchor_3221_3221" href="#Footnote_3221_3221" class="fnanchor">3221</a> But there are several peoples who consider
the Levirate a duty rather than a right.<a id="FNanchor_3222_3222" href="#Footnote_3222_3222" class="fnanchor">3222</a> Among the
Thlinkets, for example, when a husband dies, his brother or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
his sister’s son must marry the widow, and the neglect of this
obligation has occasioned bloody feuds.<a id="FNanchor_3223_3223" href="#Footnote_3223_3223" class="fnanchor">3223</a> The law requiring
a man to take care of a sister-in-law is analogous to other
duties devolving on kinsfolk, such as the vendetta, &amp;c.
Mr. McLennan lays stress on the fact that it is the deceased
husband’s <i>brother</i> who inherits his widow. “How
came the right of succession,” he says, “to open, as in the
ruder cases, to the brother in preference to the son of the
deceased? We repeat that the only explanation that can be
given of this is, that the law of succession was derived from
polyandry.”<a id="FNanchor_3224_3224" href="#Footnote_3224_3224" class="fnanchor">3224</a> But among many of the peoples who have the
custom of the Levirate, sons either inherit nothing or are
preceded by brothers in succession.<a id="FNanchor_3225_3225" href="#Footnote_3225_3225" class="fnanchor">3225</a> Among the Santals, for
instance, “when the elder brother dies, the next younger
inherits the widow, children, and all the property.”<a id="FNanchor_3226_3226" href="#Footnote_3226_3226" class="fnanchor">3226</a> Among
a few peoples, the widow together with the other property of
the dead man goes either to his brother or to his sister’s son.<a id="FNanchor_3227_3227" href="#Footnote_3227_3227" class="fnanchor">3227</a>
But it is more natural, where succession runs in the female
line, that the widow should be married by the brother than
by the nephew, because, as a rule, she is much older than the
nephew, and he, in many cases, is too young to marry and to
maintain her properly.</p>

<p>Even when a son inherits the other property of his father,
it is easy to understand why he does not inherit the widow.
To inherit her is, generally speaking, to marry her. But
nowhere is a son allowed to marry his own mother; hence it
is natural, at least where monogamy prevails, that the right of
succession in this case should belong to the brother. In poly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>gynous
families, on the other hand, it often happens that the
eldest son, or all the sons, inherit the father’s widows, the
mother being in each case excepted.<a id="FNanchor_3228_3228" href="#Footnote_3228_3228" class="fnanchor">3228</a> Among the Bakalai, a
tribe in Equatorial Africa, widows are permitted to marry the
son of their deceased husband, and, if there be no son, they
may live with the deceased husband’s brother.<a id="FNanchor_3229_3229" href="#Footnote_3229_3229" class="fnanchor">3229</a> As regards
the Negroes of Benin, Bosman states that, if the mother of
the eldest son, the only heir, be alive, he allows her a proper
maintenance, but his father’s other widows, especially those
who have not had children, the son takes home, if he
likes them, and uses as his own; but if the deceased
leaves no children, the brother inherits all his property.<a id="FNanchor_3230_3230" href="#Footnote_3230_3230" class="fnanchor">3230</a>
Among the Mishmis, the heir obtains the wives, with the
exception of his own mother, who goes to the next male
relation.<a id="FNanchor_3231_3231" href="#Footnote_3231_3231" class="fnanchor">3231</a> Concerning the Kafirs of Natal, Mr. Shooter
observes that, “when a man dies, those wives who have not
left the kraal remain with the eldest son. If they wish to
marry again, they must go to one of their late husband’s
brothers.”<a id="FNanchor_3232_3232" href="#Footnote_3232_3232" class="fnanchor">3232</a> The rules of succession are thus modified according
to circumstances, and they are not uniform even
among the same people. It frequently happens that the
brother succeeds to the chieftainship, whilst the son inherits
the property of the dead man<a id="FNanchor_3233_3233" href="#Footnote_3233_3233" class="fnanchor">3233</a>—no doubt because the brother,
being older and more experienced, is generally better fitted
for command than the son.<a id="FNanchor_3234_3234" href="#Footnote_3234_3234" class="fnanchor">3234</a></p>

<p>Mr. McLennan calls attention to the fact that, among certain
peoples, the children begotten by the brother are accounted
the children of the brother deceased.<a id="FNanchor_3235_3235" href="#Footnote_3235_3235" class="fnanchor">3235</a> “It is obvious,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
says, “that it could more easily be feigned that the children
belonged to the brother deceased, if already, at a prior stage,
the children of the brotherhood had been accounted the
children of the eldest brother, <i>i.e.</i>, if we suppose the obligation
to be a relic of polyandry.”<a id="FNanchor_3236_3236" href="#Footnote_3236_3236" class="fnanchor">3236</a> But this explanation is
very far-fetched. As Dr. Starcke justly observes, a man may,
from a juridical point of view, be the father of a child, though
he is not so in fact.<a id="FNanchor_3237_3237" href="#Footnote_3237_3237" class="fnanchor">3237</a> In New Guinea, says M. Bink, “à la
mort du père, c’est l’oncle (frère du père) qui se charge de
la tutelle; si l’enfant devient orphelin, il reconnaît son oncle
comme son père.”<a id="FNanchor_3238_3238" href="#Footnote_3238_3238" class="fnanchor">3238</a> In Samoa, the brother of a deceased
husband considered himself entitled to have his brother’s
wife, and to be regarded by the orphan children as their
father.<a id="FNanchor_3239_3239" href="#Footnote_3239_3239" class="fnanchor">3239</a> And, among the Kafirs of Natal, the children of a
deceased man’s widow born in marriage with his brother,
belong to his son.<a id="FNanchor_3240_3240" href="#Footnote_3240_3240" class="fnanchor">3240</a> Quite in accordance with these facts,
the children of a widow may be considered to belong to
her former husband. Indeed, where death without posterity
is looked upon as a horrible calamity, the ownership of the
children is a thing of the utmost importance for the dead
man. It is only when the deceased has no offspring that the
Jewish, Hindu, and Malagasy laws prescribe that the brother
shall “raise up seed” to him.</p>

<p>Mr. McLennan has thus failed in his attempt to prove that
polyandry has formed a general stage in the development
of marriage institutions; and we may almost with certainty
infer that it has always been exceptional. We have already
pointed out the groundlessness of Mr. McLennan’s suggestion
that in all, or nearly all, the primitive hordes there was
a want of balance between the sexes, the men being in the
majority on account of female infanticide.<a id="FNanchor_3241_3241" href="#Footnote_3241_3241" class="fnanchor">3241</a> Moreover, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
polyandry is due to an excess of men, it would be a mistake
to conclude that an excess of men always causes polyandry.
This practice presupposes an abnormally feeble disposition to
jealousy—a peculiarity of all peoples among whom polyandry
occurs. The Eskimo are described as a race with
extraordinarily weak passions.<a id="FNanchor_3242_3242" href="#Footnote_3242_3242" class="fnanchor">3242</a> Among the Sinhalese, says
Dr. Davy, jealousy is not very troublesome among the men,
and the infidelity of a woman is generally easily forgiven.<a id="FNanchor_3243_3243" href="#Footnote_3243_3243" class="fnanchor">3243</a> The
people of Ladakh are a mild, timid, and indolent race.<a id="FNanchor_3244_3244" href="#Footnote_3244_3244" class="fnanchor">3244</a> The
Kulu husbands “sont très peu jaloux.”<a id="FNanchor_3245_3245" href="#Footnote_3245_3245" class="fnanchor">3245</a> The same is said
by Mr. Fraser with regard to the people of Sirmore. The
women are “entirely at the service of such as will pay for
their favours, without feeling the slightest sense of shame or
crime in a practice from which they are not discouraged by
early education, example, or even the dread of their lords,
who only require a part of the profit.”<a id="FNanchor_3246_3246" href="#Footnote_3246_3246" class="fnanchor">3246</a> The Tibetans are
represented as very little addicted to jealousy,<a id="FNanchor_3247_3247" href="#Footnote_3247_3247" class="fnanchor">3247</a> being, as Mr.
Wilson remarks, a race of a peculiarly placid and unpassionate
temperament.<a id="FNanchor_3248_3248" href="#Footnote_3248_3248" class="fnanchor">3248</a> But such a lack of jealousy, as we
have seen, is a rare exception in the human race, and utterly
unlikely to have been universal at any time.</p>

<p>Polyandry seems, indeed, to presuppose a certain amount
of civilization. We have no trustworthy account of its
occurrence among the lowest savage races. Mr. Bridges
writes that the Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego consider it
utterly abominable. With regard to the Veddahs, Mr. Bailey
states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span> “Polyandry is unknown among them. The practice is
alluded to with genuine disgust. I asked a Veddah once
what the consequence would be if one of their women were
to live with two husbands, and the unaffected vehemence with
which he raised his axe, and said, ‘A blow would settle it,’
showed conclusively to my mind the natural repugnance with
which they regard the national custom of their Kandyan
neighbours.”<a id="FNanchor_3249_3249" href="#Footnote_3249_3249" class="fnanchor">3249</a> These neighbours are much superior to the
Veddahs in civilization; and the other peoples practising
polyandry have left the lowest stages of development far behind
them. The Eskimo are a rather advanced race, and so
are the polyandrous nations of the Asiatic continent. Speaking
of the people of Sirmore, Mr. Fraser observes, “It is
remarkable that a people so degraded in morals, and many
of whose customs are of so revolting a nature, should in other
respects evince a much higher advancement in civilization
than we discover among other nations, whose manners are
more engaging, and whose moral character ranks infinitely
higher. Their persons are better clad and more decent; their
approach more polite and unembarrassed; and their address is
better than that of most of the inhabitants of the remote
Highlands of Scotland; ... and their houses, in point
of construction, comfort and internal cleanliness, are beyond
comparison superior to Scottish Highland dwellings.”<a id="FNanchor_3250_3250" href="#Footnote_3250_3250" class="fnanchor">3250</a> On
the arrival of the Spaniards, the polyandrous inhabitants of
Lancerote were distinguished from the other Canarians, who
were strictly monogamous, by marks of greater civilization.<a id="FNanchor_3251_3251" href="#Footnote_3251_3251" class="fnanchor">3251</a></p>

<p>We have seen that in polyandrous families the husbands
are generally brothers, and that the eldest brother, at least in
many cases, has the superiority, the younger husbands having
almost the position, if the term may be used, of male concubines.
It is a fair conclusion that, in such instances, polyandry was
originally an expression of fraternal benevolence on the part
of the eldest brother, who gave his younger brothers a share
in his wife, if, on account of the scarcity of women, they would
otherwise have had to live unmarried. If additional wives were
afterwards acquired, they would naturally be considered the
common property of all the brothers. In this way the group-marriage
of the Toda type seems to have been evolved.</p>

<small>THE DURATION OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</small></h2>


<p>The time during which marriage lasts, varies very considerably
among different species. According to Dr. Brehm,
most birds pair for life,<a id="FNanchor_3252_3252" href="#Footnote_3252_3252" class="fnanchor">3252</a> while among the mammals, with the
exception of man and perhaps the anthropomorphous apes,
the same male and female scarcely ever live together longer
than a year.<a id="FNanchor_3253_3253" href="#Footnote_3253_3253" class="fnanchor">3253</a> In human marriage every degree of duration is
met with—from unions which, though legally recognized as
marriages, do not endure long enough to deserve to be so
called, to others which are dissolved only by death.</p>

<p>There are a few remarkable instances of peoples among
whom separation is said to be entirely unknown. In the
Andaman Islands, according to Mr. Man, “no incompatibility
of temper or other cause is allowed to dissolve the union.”<a id="FNanchor_3254_3254" href="#Footnote_3254_3254" class="fnanchor">3254</a>
The same is said of certain Papuans of New Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_3255_3255" href="#Footnote_3255_3255" class="fnanchor">3255</a> and of
several tribes of the Indian Archipelago who have remained
in their native state, and continue to follow ancient custom.<a id="FNanchor_3256_3256" href="#Footnote_3256_3256" class="fnanchor">3256</a>
The Veddahs of Ceylon have a proverb that “death alone
separates husband and wife;” and Mr. Bailey assures us that
they faithfully act on this principle.<a id="FNanchor_3257_3257" href="#Footnote_3257_3257" class="fnanchor">3257</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span></p>

<p>As a general rule, however, human marriage is not
necessarily contracted for life. The Indians of North
America dissolve their unions as readily as they enter into
them. The Wyandots had, it is said, marriages upon trial,
which were binding for a few days only.<a id="FNanchor_3258_3258" href="#Footnote_3258_3258" class="fnanchor">3258</a> In Greenland,
husband and wife sometimes separate after living together
for half a year.<a id="FNanchor_3259_3259" href="#Footnote_3259_3259" class="fnanchor">3259</a> Among the Creeks, “marriage is considered
only as a temporary convenience, not binding on the parties
more than one year,” the consequence being that “a large portion
of the old and middle-aged men, by frequently changing,
have had many different wives, and their children, scattered
around the country, are unknown to them.”<a id="FNanchor_3260_3260" href="#Footnote_3260_3260" class="fnanchor">3260</a> Speaking of the
Botocudos, Mr. Keane remarks that their marriages “are all
of a purely temporary nature, contracted without formalities
of any sort, dissolved on the slightest pretext, or without any
pretext, merely through love of change or caprice.”<a id="FNanchor_3261_3261" href="#Footnote_3261_3261" class="fnanchor">3261</a> In Ruk,
it frequently happens that newly married husbands repudiate
their wives;<a id="FNanchor_3262_3262" href="#Footnote_3262_3262" class="fnanchor">3262</a> and, in the Pelew and Kingsmill Groups, and
among the aborigines of Northern Queensland, divorces are
of common occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_3263_3263" href="#Footnote_3263_3263" class="fnanchor">3263</a> “Tasmanian lords,” says Dr.
Milligan, “had no difficulty, and made no scruple, about a
succession of wives.”<a id="FNanchor_3264_3264" href="#Footnote_3264_3264" class="fnanchor">3264</a> Again, in Samoa, “if the marriage had
been contracted merely for the sake of the property and
festivities of the occasion, the wife was not likely to be more
than a few days, or weeks, with her husband.”<a id="FNanchor_3265_3265" href="#Footnote_3265_3265" class="fnanchor">3265</a> In several
of the Islands of the Indian Archipelago, “in the regular
marriages the parties are always betrothed to each other for a
longer or shorter time, sometimes not for more than a month
and at others for a period of years.”<a id="FNanchor_3266_3266" href="#Footnote_3266_3266" class="fnanchor">3266</a> Among the Dyaks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
there are few middle-aged men who have not had several
wives, and instances have been known of young women of
seventeen or eighteen who had already lived with three or
four husbands.<a id="FNanchor_3267_3267" href="#Footnote_3267_3267" class="fnanchor">3267</a> Among the Yendalines in Indo-China, it is
rare for any woman to arrive at middle age without having a
family by two or more husbands.<a id="FNanchor_3268_3268" href="#Footnote_3268_3268" class="fnanchor">3268</a> The Maldivians, as we are
informed by Mr. Rosset, are so fond of change that many a
man marries and divorces the same woman three or four
times in the course of his life.<a id="FNanchor_3269_3269" href="#Footnote_3269_3269" class="fnanchor">3269</a> Among the Sinhalese,
according to Knox, “both men and women have frequently
to marry four or five times before they can settle down contented;”<a id="FNanchor_3270_3270" href="#Footnote_3270_3270" class="fnanchor">3270</a>
and Father Bourien says of the Mantras of the
interior of the Malay Peninsula, that it is not uncommon to
meet individuals who have married even forty or fifty different
times.<a id="FNanchor_3271_3271" href="#Footnote_3271_3271" class="fnanchor">3271</a> Among the Munda Kols, Khasias, Tartars,<a id="FNanchor_3272_3272" href="#Footnote_3272_3272" class="fnanchor">3272</a> and
most Mohammedan peoples,<a id="FNanchor_3273_3273" href="#Footnote_3273_3273" class="fnanchor">3273</a> divorces are very frequent.
According to Dr. van der Berg, an even more fatal influence
is exercised on family life in the East by this laxity of the
marriage tie than by polygyny.<a id="FNanchor_3274_3274" href="#Footnote_3274_3274" class="fnanchor">3274</a> Burckhardt knew Bedouins
forty-five years old who had had more than fifty wives.<a id="FNanchor_3275_3275" href="#Footnote_3275_3275" class="fnanchor">3275</a> A
“Sighe” wife in Persia is taken in marriage for a certain
legally stipulated period, which may vary from one hour to
ninety-nine years.<a id="FNanchor_3276_3276" href="#Footnote_3276_3276" class="fnanchor">3276</a> In Cairo, according to Mr. Lane, there
are not many persons who have not divorced one wife, if they
have been married for a long time; and many men in Egypt
have in the course of two years married as many as twenty,
thirty, or more wives; whilst there are women, not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
advanced in age, who have been wives to a dozen or more
men successively. Mr. Lane has even heard of men who
have been in the habit of marrying a new wife almost every
month.<a id="FNanchor_3277_3277" href="#Footnote_3277_3277" class="fnanchor">3277</a> In Morocco, Dr. Churcher writes to me, a terrible
state of things springs from the ease with which divorce is
obtained; a man repudiates his wife on the slightest provocation
and marries again. “One of the servants here,” he
continues, “is reported to have had nineteen wives already,
though he is still only middle-aged.” Indeed, among the
Moors of the Sahara, according to Mr. Reade, it is considered
“low” for a couple to live too long together, and “the
leaders of fashion are those who have been the oftenest
divorced.”<a id="FNanchor_3278_3278" href="#Footnote_3278_3278" class="fnanchor">3278</a> Lobo tells us that, in Abyssinia, marriage was
usually entered upon for a term of years;<a id="FNanchor_3279_3279" href="#Footnote_3279_3279" class="fnanchor">3279</a> and, among the
Somals, separation is exceedingly common.<a id="FNanchor_3280_3280" href="#Footnote_3280_3280" class="fnanchor">3280</a> Many negro
peoples marry upon trial or for a fixed time.<a id="FNanchor_3281_3281" href="#Footnote_3281_3281" class="fnanchor">3281</a> Among the
Negroes of Bondo, a man may so often send away his wife
and take a new one that it is difficult to know who is the
father of the children born.<a id="FNanchor_3282_3282" href="#Footnote_3282_3282" class="fnanchor">3282</a> Regarding the ancient Persians,
Professor Rawlinson observes that the easiness of divorce
among the Magians was in accordance with Eranian notions
on the subject of marriage—“notions far less strict than
those which have commonly prevailed among civilized
nations.”<a id="FNanchor_3283_3283" href="#Footnote_3283_3283" class="fnanchor">3283</a> Among the Greeks, especially the Athenians,<a id="FNanchor_3284_3284" href="#Footnote_3284_3284" class="fnanchor">3284</a> and
among the Teutons,<a id="FNanchor_3285_3285" href="#Footnote_3285_3285" class="fnanchor">3285</a> divorce often occurred; and in Rome, at
the close of the Republic and the commencement of the Empire,
it prevailed to a frightful extent.<a id="FNanchor_3286_3286" href="#Footnote_3286_3286" class="fnanchor">3286</a></p>

<p>Among uncivilized races, as a rule, and among many
advanced peoples, a man may divorce his wife whenever
he likes. The Aleuts used to exchange their wives for food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
and clothes.<a id="FNanchor_3287_3287" href="#Footnote_3287_3287" class="fnanchor">3287</a> In Tonga, a husband divorces his wife by
simply telling her that she may go.<a id="FNanchor_3288_3288" href="#Footnote_3288_3288" class="fnanchor">3288</a> Among the Hovas of
Madagascar, until the spread of Christianity, marriage was
compared to a knot so lightly tied that it could be undone
with the slightest possible touch.<a id="FNanchor_3289_3289" href="#Footnote_3289_3289" class="fnanchor">3289</a> In Yucatan, a man might
divorce his wife for the merest trifle, even though he had
children by her.<a id="FNanchor_3290_3290" href="#Footnote_3290_3290" class="fnanchor">3290</a> Among the ancient Hebrews,<a id="FNanchor_3291_3291" href="#Footnote_3291_3291" class="fnanchor">3291</a> Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_3292_3292" href="#Footnote_3292_3292" class="fnanchor">3292</a>
Romans,<a id="FNanchor_3293_3293" href="#Footnote_3293_3293" class="fnanchor">3293</a> and Germans,<a id="FNanchor_3294_3294" href="#Footnote_3294_3294" class="fnanchor">3294</a> dislike was considered a sufficient
reason for divorce, which was regarded as merely a private
act.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, among a great many peoples, although
a husband may divorce his wife, he does so only under certain
exceptional conditions, marriage, as a rule, being concluded
for life.<a id="FNanchor_3295_3295" href="#Footnote_3295_3295" class="fnanchor">3295</a> The Greenlanders seldom repudiate wives
who have had children.<a id="FNanchor_3296_3296" href="#Footnote_3296_3296" class="fnanchor">3296</a> Among the Californian Wintun,
according to Mr. Powers, it is very uncommon for a man to
expel his wife. “In a moment of passion he may strike her
dead, or ... ignominiously slink away with another, but
the idea of divorcing and sending away a wife does not occur
to him.”<a id="FNanchor_3297_3297" href="#Footnote_3297_3297" class="fnanchor">3297</a> Among the Naudowessies, divorce is so rare that
Carver had no opportunity of learning how it is accomplished.<a id="FNanchor_3298_3298" href="#Footnote_3298_3298" class="fnanchor">3298</a>
Speaking of several tribes on the eastern side of the Rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
Mountains, Harmon remarks that separation between husband
and wife is seldom permanent, the parties, after a few days’
absence from one another, generally having an inclination to
come together again.<a id="FNanchor_3299_3299" href="#Footnote_3299_3299" class="fnanchor">3299</a> The Iroquois, in ancient times, regarded
separation as discreditable to both man and woman,
hence it was not frequently practised.<a id="FNanchor_3300_3300" href="#Footnote_3300_3300" class="fnanchor">3300</a> If an Uaupé takes a
new wife, the elder one is never turned away, but remains the
mistress of the house.<a id="FNanchor_3301_3301" href="#Footnote_3301_3301" class="fnanchor">3301</a> Among the Charruas and Patagonians,
marriage lasts, as a rule, during the whole of life, if there are
children.<a id="FNanchor_3302_3302" href="#Footnote_3302_3302" class="fnanchor">3302</a> And, concerning the Yahgans, Mr. Bridges writes
that there have been many instances amongst them of husband
and wife living together until separated by death. The
same is the case in Lifu, as I am informed by Mr. Radfield.
In Tonga, according to Mariner, more than half of the number
of married women were parted from their husbands only by
death.<a id="FNanchor_3303_3303" href="#Footnote_3303_3303" class="fnanchor">3303</a> Among the Maoris<a id="FNanchor_3304_3304" href="#Footnote_3304_3304" class="fnanchor">3304</a> and the Solomon Islanders,<a id="FNanchor_3305_3305" href="#Footnote_3305_3305" class="fnanchor">3305</a> and
in New Guinea,<a id="FNanchor_3306_3306" href="#Footnote_3306_3306" class="fnanchor">3306</a> divorce is exceptional; and, even in Tahiti, the
birth of children generally prevented the dissolution of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_3307_3307" href="#Footnote_3307_3307" class="fnanchor">3307</a>
In many of the islands of the Indian Archipelago,
divorce may, by law or custom, be readily obtained, but Mr.
Crawfurd says that it is very rarely sued for.<a id="FNanchor_3308_3308" href="#Footnote_3308_3308" class="fnanchor">3308</a> The Garos,
according to Colonel Dalton, “will not hastily make engagements,
because, when they do make them, they intend to keep
them.”<a id="FNanchor_3309_3309" href="#Footnote_3309_3309" class="fnanchor">3309</a> Among the Karens, Dr. Bunker writes, separations,
save by death, are rare. Mr. Ingham informs me that, among
the Bakongo, there are plenty of instances of husband and
wife living together till death. Archdeacon Hodgson states
the same regarding the Eastern Central Africans, Mr. Swann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
regarding the Waguha, Mr. Eyles regarding the Zulus.
Among the Cis-Natalian Kafirs, according to Mr. Cousins,
marriage, in the majority of instances, is contracted for life.<a id="FNanchor_3310_3310" href="#Footnote_3310_3310" class="fnanchor">3310</a>
In the early days of Hebrew history, says Ewald, it was only
in exceptional cases that husbands made an evil use of the
right to divorce a wife.<a id="FNanchor_3311_3311" href="#Footnote_3311_3311" class="fnanchor">3311</a> Among the Greeks of the Homeric
age, divorce seems to have been almost unknown, though
it afterwards became an everyday event in Greece;<a id="FNanchor_3312_3312" href="#Footnote_3312_3312" class="fnanchor">3312</a> and in
Rome, in the earliest times, it was probably very little used.<a id="FNanchor_3313_3313" href="#Footnote_3313_3313" class="fnanchor">3313</a></p>

<p>Among many peoples custom or law has limited the husband’s
power to dispose of his wife, permitting divorce only
under certain conditions. Thus, among the Kukis, “if a
woman has a son by her husband, the marriage is indissoluble,”
though, if they do not agree, and have no son, the husband
can cast off his wife and take another.<a id="FNanchor_3314_3314" href="#Footnote_3314_3314" class="fnanchor">3314</a> The Red Karens in
Indo-China allow divorce if there are no children; “but
should there be one child, the parents are not permitted to
separate.”<a id="FNanchor_3315_3315" href="#Footnote_3315_3315" class="fnanchor">3315</a> In the tribes of Western Victoria, described by
Mr. Dawson, a man can divorce a childless wife for serious
misconduct, but in every case the charge against her must
first be laid before the chiefs of his own and his wife’s tribes,
and their consent to her punishment obtained. If the wife has
children, she cannot be divorced.<a id="FNanchor_3316_3316" href="#Footnote_3316_3316" class="fnanchor">3316</a> Among the Santals and the
Tipperahs, divorce can be effected only with the consent of the
husband’s clansmen, or a jury of village elders.<a id="FNanchor_3317_3317" href="#Footnote_3317_3317" class="fnanchor">3317</a> Several tribes
of the Indian Archipelago do not allow a man to repudiate
his wife, except in case of adultery;<a id="FNanchor_3318_3318" href="#Footnote_3318_3318" class="fnanchor">3318</a> and certain negro peoples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
have a similar rule, so far as the chief or first wife is concerned.<a id="FNanchor_3319_3319" href="#Footnote_3319_3319" class="fnanchor">3319</a>
Among the Hottentots, according to Kolben, a man may
divorce his wife only “upon showing such cause as shall be
satisfactory to the men of the kraal where they live.”<a id="FNanchor_3320_3320" href="#Footnote_3320_3320" class="fnanchor">3320</a> Mr.
Casalis states that, among the Basutos, “sterility is the only
cause of divorce which is not subject to litigation;”<a id="FNanchor_3321_3321" href="#Footnote_3321_3321" class="fnanchor">3321</a> and, according
to Toda custom, the separation of married couples
does not seem to be lightly tolerated.<a id="FNanchor_3322_3322" href="#Footnote_3322_3322" class="fnanchor">3322</a> Among certain lower
races the consent of the wife appears generally to be necessary
for separation.<a id="FNanchor_3323_3323" href="#Footnote_3323_3323" class="fnanchor">3323</a></p>

<p>Civilized nations, more commonly than savages, consider
marriage a union which must not be dissolved by the husband
except for certain reasons stipulated by law. Among the
Aztecs, it was looked upon as a tie binding for life, and
divorce was always discouraged both by the magistrates and
the community. The husband could repudiate even his concubines
only for just cause and with the sanction of the
courts, and the chief wife only for malevolence, dirtiness, or
sterility.<a id="FNanchor_3324_3324" href="#Footnote_3324_3324" class="fnanchor">3324</a> In Nicaragua, the sole offence for which a wife
could be divorced was adultery.<a id="FNanchor_3325_3325" href="#Footnote_3325_3325" class="fnanchor">3325</a> The Chinese code enumerates
seven just causes of divorce—barrenness, lasciviousness,
inattention to parents-in-law, loquacity, thievishness, ill-temper,
and inveterate infirmity,—and a husband, except for one
of these reasons, may not put away his wife on pain of receiving
eighty blows.<a id="FNanchor_3326_3326" href="#Footnote_3326_3326" class="fnanchor">3326</a> But these pretexts for divorce are very elastic.
In one of the old Chinese books we read,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span> “When a woman
has any quality that is not good, it is but just and reasonable
to turn her out of doors.... Among the ancients a
wife was turned away if she allowed the house to be full of
smoke, or if she frightened the dog with her disagreeable
noise.”<a id="FNanchor_3327_3327" href="#Footnote_3327_3327" class="fnanchor">3327</a> Nevertheless, according to Mr. Medhurst, divorce is
rare in China.<a id="FNanchor_3328_3328" href="#Footnote_3328_3328" class="fnanchor">3328</a> In Japan a man might repudiate his wife for
the same reasons as in China. But Professor Rein remarks
that the Japanese seldom made use of this privilege, especially
if there were children, as education and custom required
that, in such cases, the wife should be treated with
kindness and consideration.<a id="FNanchor_3329_3329" href="#Footnote_3329_3329" class="fnanchor">3329</a> In Arabia, Mohammed regulated
the law of divorce. “In the absence of serious reasons,”
says Ibrâhîm Halebî, “no Mussulman can justify divorce in
the eyes either of religion or the law. If he abandon his wife
or put her away from simple caprice, he draws down upon himself
the divine anger, for ‘the curse of God,’ said the Prophet,
'rests on him who repudiates his wife capriciously.’”<a id="FNanchor_3330_3330" href="#Footnote_3330_3330" class="fnanchor">3330</a> Practically,
however, a Mohammedan may, whenever he pleases,
without assigning any reason, say to his wife, “Thou art
divorced,” and she must return to her parents or friends.<a id="FNanchor_3331_3331" href="#Footnote_3331_3331" class="fnanchor">3331</a></p>

<p>According to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ a wife “who drinks
spirituous liquor, is of bad conduct, rebellious, diseased, mischievous,
or wasteful, may at any time be superseded
by another wife. A barren wife may be superseded in the
eighth year; one whose children all die, in the tenth; one who
bears only daughters, in the eleventh; but one who is quarrelsome,
without delay.”<a id="FNanchor_3332_3332" href="#Footnote_3332_3332" class="fnanchor">3332</a> At present, in Southern India,
divorce is common among many of the lower castes; but it is
not practised at all among the Brahmans and Kshatriyas, or
among the higher classes of Śudras.<a id="FNanchor_3333_3333" href="#Footnote_3333_3333" class="fnanchor">3333</a> In Rome under the
Christian Emperors, the husband’s right to put away his wife
was restricted by imperial constitutions, which pointed out
what were considered just causes of divorce.<a id="FNanchor_3334_3334" href="#Footnote_3334_3334" class="fnanchor">3334</a> The dogma of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
the indissoluble nature of marriage, early vindicated by many
Fathers in accordance with the injunction, “What God hath
joined together, let not man put asunder,” came into full
force only by degrees. The Council of Trent definitely suppressed
the last traces of divorce as a legal practice<a id="FNanchor_3335_3335" href="#Footnote_3335_3335" class="fnanchor">3335</a>—a decree
which has exercised a powerful influence on the legislation of
Roman Catholic nations. In Spain, Portugal, and Italy, a
husband can demand a judicial separation, a divorce a <i>mensâ
et thoro</i>, but the marriage contract cannot be dissolved; in
France divorce was reintroduced by the law of 27th July,
1884. In all Protestant countries divorce is allowed. In every
one of them a man may be divorced from a wife who has
committed adultery, but the other legal grounds on which a
divorce, in most of them, may be obtained, vary in different
States. According to the Prussian ‘Landrecht,’ the list includes,
among other causes, drunkenness and a disorderly life,
insanity lasting longer than a year, and the mutual consent of
the husband and wife, if they have no children;<a id="FNanchor_3336_3336" href="#Footnote_3336_3336" class="fnanchor">3336</a> in Norway
and Denmark, mutual consent, if the parties have been judicially
separated for three years previously;<a id="FNanchor_3337_3337" href="#Footnote_3337_3337" class="fnanchor">3337</a> in Austria, aversion
proved to be invincible through several preceding divorces
from bed and board.<a id="FNanchor_3338_3338" href="#Footnote_3338_3338" class="fnanchor">3338</a> The French law recognizes as causes
of divorce, besides adultery, “excès, sévices, injures graves,”
as also “condamnation à une peine afflictive et infamante.”<a id="FNanchor_3339_3339" href="#Footnote_3339_3339" class="fnanchor">3339</a></p>

<p>Marriage may be dissolved not only by the man but by the
woman. In Madagascar, says Mr. Sibree, although “the
power of divorce is legally in the husband’s hand, a wife can
practically divorce herself in several cases.<a id="FNanchor_3340_3340" href="#Footnote_3340_3340" class="fnanchor">3340</a> The like holds
true for many of the lower races;<a id="FNanchor_3341_3341" href="#Footnote_3341_3341" class="fnanchor">3341</a> whilst, among others, cus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>tom
or law seems to permit a wife to separate at least under
certain conditions.<a id="FNanchor_3342_3342" href="#Footnote_3342_3342" class="fnanchor">3342</a> Among the Inland Columbians, according
to Mr. Bancroft, “either party may dissolve the marriage
at will.”<a id="FNanchor_3343_3343" href="#Footnote_3343_3343" class="fnanchor">3343</a> If a Bonak wife gets up and leaves the man, he
has no claim ever after on her.<a id="FNanchor_3344_3344" href="#Footnote_3344_3344" class="fnanchor">3344</a> Among the Navajos, when
a woman marries, “she becomes free, and may leave her
husband for sufficient cause.”<a id="FNanchor_3345_3345" href="#Footnote_3345_3345" class="fnanchor">3345</a> Regarding the Guanas, Azara
states, “Le divorce est libre aux deux sexes, comme tout le
reste, et les femmes y sont très-portées.”<a id="FNanchor_3346_3346" href="#Footnote_3346_3346" class="fnanchor">3346</a> In the Sandwich
Islands, “a man and woman live together as long as they
please, and may, at any time, separate, and make choice of
other partners.”<a id="FNanchor_3347_3347" href="#Footnote_3347_3347" class="fnanchor">3347</a> In Tahiti, parts of New Guinea, and in the
Marianne Group, the marriage tie may, it is said, be dissolved
whenever either of the parties desires it.<a id="FNanchor_3348_3348" href="#Footnote_3348_3348" class="fnanchor">3348</a> In some of the
smaller islands of the Indian Archipelago, a wife can sue for
divorce if her husband ill-treats her, if he is unfaithful, or for
other reasons.<a id="FNanchor_3349_3349" href="#Footnote_3349_3349" class="fnanchor">3349</a> Among the Shans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span> “should the husband take
to drinking, or otherwise misconducting himself, the woman
has the right to turn him adrift, and to retain all the goods
and money of the partnership.”<a id="FNanchor_3350_3350" href="#Footnote_3350_3350" class="fnanchor">3350</a> In Burma, if one of the
parties is unwilling to separate, “the other is free to go, provided
all property except the clothes in wear is left behind;”
and a wife can demand a divorce for ill-treatment, or if her
husband cannot properly maintain her.<a id="FNanchor_3351_3351" href="#Footnote_3351_3351" class="fnanchor">3351</a> Among the Irulas
of the Neilgherries, the option of remaining in union, or of
separating, rests principally with the woman.<a id="FNanchor_3352_3352" href="#Footnote_3352_3352" class="fnanchor">3352</a> According to
Kandh custom, a wife can return to her father’s house within
six months after the marriage, on the articles which had been
paid for her being restored; and, if childless, she can at any
time quit her husband. “In no case,” says Sir W. W. Hunter,
“can the husband forcibly reclaim her, but a wife separated
on any grounds whatsoever from her husband cannot marry
again.”<a id="FNanchor_3353_3353" href="#Footnote_3353_3353" class="fnanchor">3353</a> In Eastern Central Africa, divorce may be effected
if the husband neglects to sew his wife’s clothes, or if the
partners do not please each other.<a id="FNanchor_3354_3354" href="#Footnote_3354_3354" class="fnanchor">3354</a> And, among the Garenganze,
according to Mr. Arnot, a wife “may leave her husband
at any time, if she cares to do so.”<a id="FNanchor_3355_3355" href="#Footnote_3355_3355" class="fnanchor">3355</a></p>

<p>Passing to more advanced nations, we find that, among the
ancient Mexicans, the wife, as well as the husband, might sue
for separation.<a id="FNanchor_3356_3356" href="#Footnote_3356_3356" class="fnanchor">3356</a> In Guatemala, she could leave him on
grounds as slight as those on which he could leave her.<a id="FNanchor_3357_3357" href="#Footnote_3357_3357" class="fnanchor">3357</a> In
China, on the other hand, a woman cannot obtain legal
separation; and the same was the case in Japan till the year
1873.<a id="FNanchor_3358_3358" href="#Footnote_3358_3358" class="fnanchor">3358</a> According to the Talmudic Law, the wife is authorized
to demand a divorce if the husband refuses to perform
his conjugal duty, if he continues to lead a disorderly life
after marriage, if he proves impotent during ten years, if he
suffers from an insupportable disease, or if he leaves the country
for ever.<a id="FNanchor_3359_3359" href="#Footnote_3359_3359" class="fnanchor">3359</a> According to Mohammedan legislation, divorce may,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
in certain cases, take place at the instance of the wife, and,
if cruelly treated or neglected by her husband, she has the
right of demanding a divorce by authority of justice.<a id="FNanchor_3360_3360" href="#Footnote_3360_3360" class="fnanchor">3360</a> The
ancient Hindus<a id="FNanchor_3361_3361" href="#Footnote_3361_3361" class="fnanchor">3361</a> and Teutons<a id="FNanchor_3362_3362" href="#Footnote_3362_3362" class="fnanchor">3362</a> allowed a wife to separate
from her husband only in certain exceptional cases. According
to Gallic laws, a wife could quit her husband without
losing her <i>dos</i>, “si leprosus sit vir; si habeat fetidum anhelatum,
et si cum ea concumbere non possit.”<a id="FNanchor_3363_3363" href="#Footnote_3363_3363" class="fnanchor">3363</a> Among the
Saxons and Danes in England, marriage might be dissolved
at the pleasure of either party, the wife, however, being obliged
to return the price paid for her, if she deserted the husband
without his consent.<a id="FNanchor_3364_3364" href="#Footnote_3364_3364" class="fnanchor">3364</a> At Athens, a woman could demand
a divorce if she was ill-treated by her husband, in which
case she had merely to announce her wish before the ἄρχων.<a id="FNanchor_3365_3365" href="#Footnote_3365_3365" class="fnanchor">3365</a>
Rossbach thinks that, in Rome, a marriage with <i>manus</i>
could be dissolved by the husband only, a marriage without
<i>manus</i> by the wife’s father also.<a id="FNanchor_3366_3366" href="#Footnote_3366_3366" class="fnanchor">3366</a> But Lord Mackenzie observes
that, whatever effect <i>conventio in manum</i> may have had
in ancient times, it did not, in the age of Gaius, limit the
wife’s freedom to seek divorce.<a id="FNanchor_3367_3367" href="#Footnote_3367_3367" class="fnanchor">3367</a> In those Christian States of
Europe where absolute divorce is permitted, the grounds on
which it may be sued for are nearly the same for the man and
the woman—except in England, where the husband must be
accused of one or other of several offences besides adultery.
In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, a judicial separation may always
be decreed on the ground of the adultery of the wife, but, on
the ground of the adultery of the husband, only if it has been
committed under certain aggravating circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_3368_3368" href="#Footnote_3368_3368" class="fnanchor">3368</a></p>

<p>The causes by which duration of human marriage is
influenced are, on the whole, the same as those which determine
the form of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p>

<p>Man’s appetite for youth and beauty often induces him to
repudiate a wife who has grown old and ugly. According to
Cook, it was much more common for a Tahitian to cast off
the first wife and take a more youthful partner than to live
with both.<a id="FNanchor_3369_3369" href="#Footnote_3369_3369" class="fnanchor">3369</a> Among the Aleuts, when a wife “ceases to
possess attractions or value in the eyes of her proprietor, she
is sent back to her friends.”<a id="FNanchor_3370_3370" href="#Footnote_3370_3370" class="fnanchor">3370</a> A Malay, in many cases, turns
away his wife as soon as she becomes ugly from hard work
and maternal cares.<a id="FNanchor_3371_3371" href="#Footnote_3371_3371" class="fnanchor">3371</a> In Switzerland, marriage is much
oftener dissolved through divorce when the wife is the
husband’s senior, than when the reverse is the case.<a id="FNanchor_3372_3372" href="#Footnote_3372_3372" class="fnanchor">3372</a></p>

<p>Dr. Béringer-Féraud observes that the Moors in the region
of the Senegal “divorcent avec une facilité extrême, non
seulement sous le prétexte le plus futile, mais souvent, et
même uniquement, pour le plaisir de changer.”<a id="FNanchor_3373_3373" href="#Footnote_3373_3373" class="fnanchor">3373</a> According
to v. Oettingen, the statistics of divorce and remarriage in
Europe prove that the taste for variety is often the chief
cause of the dissolution of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_3374_3374" href="#Footnote_3374_3374" class="fnanchor">3374</a></p>

<p>As the desire for offspring is a frequent cause of divorce,<a id="FNanchor_3375_3375" href="#Footnote_3375_3375" class="fnanchor">3375</a>
so the birth of children is generally the best guarantee for
the continuance of the marriage tie. Speaking of some
Indian tribes of North America, Schoolcraft says, “The best
protection to married females arises from the ties of children,
which, by bringing into play the strong natural affections of
the heart, appeal at once to that principle in man’s original
organization which is the strongest.”<a id="FNanchor_3376_3376" href="#Footnote_3376_3376" class="fnanchor">3376</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span></p>

<p>Where women are regarded almost as beasts of burden, it
often happens that a wife who is a bad worker is divorced.
The Dyak husbands “coolly dismiss their helpmates when
too lazy or too weak to work, and select partners better qualified
to undergo the toils of life.”<a id="FNanchor_3377_3377" href="#Footnote_3377_3377" class="fnanchor">3377</a> Among the Sinhalese,
according to Mr. Bailey, sickness is perhaps the most common
reason why a husband repudiates his wife. The heartless
desertion of a sick wife, he says, is “the worst trait in the
Kandyan character, and the cool and unconcerned manner in
which they themselves allude to it, shows that it is as common
as it is cruel.”<a id="FNanchor_3378_3378" href="#Footnote_3378_3378" class="fnanchor">3378</a></p>

<p>However desirable separation, in many cases, may be for
the husband, there are various circumstances which tend to
prevent him from recklessly repudiating his wife. In many
instances divorce implies for the man a loss of fortune.
Though not, as a rule,<a id="FNanchor_3379_3379" href="#Footnote_3379_3379" class="fnanchor">3379</a> obliged to provide the divorced wife
with the full means of subsistence, he must, as already mentioned,
usually give her what she brought with her into the
house, and, among several peoples, a certain proportion—often
the half—of the common wealth.<a id="FNanchor_3380_3380" href="#Footnote_3380_3380" class="fnanchor">3380</a> Among the Karens,
if a man leaves his wife, the rule is that the house and all the
property belong to her, nothing being his but what he takes
with him.<a id="FNanchor_3381_3381" href="#Footnote_3381_3381" class="fnanchor">3381</a> Among the Manipuris, according to Colonel
Dalton, a wife who is put away without fault on her part,
takes all the personal property of the husband, except one
drinking cup and the cloth round his loins.<a id="FNanchor_3382_3382" href="#Footnote_3382_3382" class="fnanchor">3382</a> Similar rules
prevail among the Galela, and in the Marianne Group.<a id="FNanchor_3383_3383" href="#Footnote_3383_3383" class="fnanchor">3383</a> As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
to the ancient Teutons, M. Glasson observes, “Les lois
barbares voulaient d’ailleurs que, sauf le cas d’adultère, la
femme répudiée eût son existence assurée. Le mari devait
lui laisser la maison et tout ce qu’elle contenait; il était
même obligé de lui abandonner l’équivalent du <i>mundium</i>
et de payer une amende au fisc s’il répudiait sa femme sans
aucun motif sérieux.”<a id="FNanchor_3384_3384" href="#Footnote_3384_3384" class="fnanchor">3384</a></p>

<p>The practice of purchasing wives forms a very important
obstacle to frequent repudiation.<a id="FNanchor_3385_3385" href="#Footnote_3385_3385" class="fnanchor">3385</a> If the wife proves barren,
or is unfaithful, or otherwise affords sufficient cause of divorce,
the husband generally receives back what he has paid for
her;<a id="FNanchor_3386_3386" href="#Footnote_3386_3386" class="fnanchor">3386</a> but, if he repudiates her without satisfactory grounds,
the purchase sum is usually forfeited.<a id="FNanchor_3387_3387" href="#Footnote_3387_3387" class="fnanchor">3387</a> “Cases of divorce
are very frequent,” says Mr. Casalis, “where the price of the
wife is of small value. Among the Basutos, where it is of
considerable amount, the dissolution of marriage is attended
with much difficulty.”<a id="FNanchor_3388_3388" href="#Footnote_3388_3388" class="fnanchor">3388</a> And Dr. Finsch ascribes the frequency
of divorce in Ponapé to the fact that wife-purchase
does not exist there.<a id="FNanchor_3389_3389" href="#Footnote_3389_3389" class="fnanchor">3389</a></p>

<p>Moreover, when he divorces his wife, a man very often
loses his children at the same time. Among several peoples
they remain the property of the father.<a id="FNanchor_3390_3390" href="#Footnote_3390_3390" class="fnanchor">3390</a> Among others,
they are taken in some cases by the man, in others by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
woman.<a id="FNanchor_3391_3391" href="#Footnote_3391_3391" class="fnanchor">3391</a> In Samoa, the young children followed the
mother, the more advanced the father;<a id="FNanchor_3392_3392" href="#Footnote_3392_3392" class="fnanchor">3392</a> whilst, among the
Sinhalese, boys are taken by the latter, girls by the former.<a id="FNanchor_3393_3393" href="#Footnote_3393_3393" class="fnanchor">3393</a>
But among many uncivilized peoples, all the children, if
young, follow the mother,<a id="FNanchor_3394_3394" href="#Footnote_3394_3394" class="fnanchor">3394</a> as Colden says, “according to the
natural course of all animals.”<a id="FNanchor_3395_3395" href="#Footnote_3395_3395" class="fnanchor">3395</a></p>

<p>Another factor which has much influence upon the stability
of marriage, is the position held by women. When some regard
is paid to their feelings, a husband does not, of course, put
his wife away for trivial reasons, divorce meaning for her, in
many cases, misery and distress. Dr. Churcher informs me
from Morocco that “the divorced woman too often goes to
swell the ranks of the prostitutes.” And the same is the case
in China and among the Arabs of the Sahara.<a id="FNanchor_3396_3396" href="#Footnote_3396_3396" class="fnanchor">3396</a></p>

<p>When a man and woman unite with one another from
love, there is, of course, more security that the marriage
contract will be lasting. The Mantras, says Father Bourien,
“frequently marry without previously knowing one another,
and live together without loving. Is it, then, astonishing that
they part without regret, and that divorce is frequent among
them?”<a id="FNanchor_3397_3397" href="#Footnote_3397_3397" class="fnanchor">3397</a> The facility of Mohammedan divorce, as Mr. Bos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>worth
Smith remarks, is the necessary consequence of the
separation of the sexes. “A man would never embark in the
hazardous lottery of Eastern marriage, if he had not the
escape of divorce from the woman whom he has never seen,
and who may be in every way uncongenial to him.”<a id="FNanchor_3398_3398" href="#Footnote_3398_3398" class="fnanchor">3398</a> A union
with a first cousin, among Mohammedans, is generally lasting,
because early associations may have led to an attachment at
a tender age.<a id="FNanchor_3399_3399" href="#Footnote_3399_3399" class="fnanchor">3399</a> Separation is especially rare when the uniting
passion is not merely of a sensual nature, but involves
mutual sympathy depending upon mental qualities.</p>

<p>Many of the factors which influence the duration of marriage,
so far as it depends upon the will of the husband,
operate also in cases where marriage may be dissolved by the
wife. But the woman’s subordinate position and her inability
to support herself, makes separation more difficult for her than
for the man.<a id="FNanchor_3400_3400" href="#Footnote_3400_3400" class="fnanchor">3400</a> Moreover, if the woman claims a divorce, the
purchase-sum paid for her has to be returned,<a id="FNanchor_3401_3401" href="#Footnote_3401_3401" class="fnanchor">3401</a> and she may
even, in certain cases, forfeit her dowry and whatever property
she brought with her at marriage.<a id="FNanchor_3402_3402" href="#Footnote_3402_3402" class="fnanchor">3402</a> If she must lose her
children also, she will naturally shrink from the idea of
separation.</p>

<p>Since the causes which influence the duration of marriage
are, to so great an extent, the same as those which influence
the form of marriage, so far as monogamy and polygyny are
concerned, we might expect strict monogamy to be associated
with stability of marriage, and extensive polygyny with instability.
But this is only partly the case. When monogamy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
is chiefly due to the man’s inability to support many wives, or
when he secures no economical advantage by a plurality of
wives, he tries in many cases to make up for the inconveniences
of monogamy by a frequent change of mate. Mr. Bickmore
thinks that the reason why polygyny is not more generally
practised by the Mohammedan Malays is to be found in
the facility with which divorce is obtained and a new
marriage contracted.<a id="FNanchor_3403_3403" href="#Footnote_3403_3403" class="fnanchor">3403</a> And the Arabs of Asia and the
Moors of the Western Sahara, according to Burckhardt and
Chavanne, indemnify themselves through a succession of
wives for their monogamous habits.<a id="FNanchor_3404_3404" href="#Footnote_3404_3404" class="fnanchor">3404</a> Considering, further,
that the proportion between the sexes, and the monogamous
instinct which man in early times probably shared with
others of the higher primates, have affected the forms of
human marriage, but scarcely at all its duration, we may
infer that the development of the latter, at least at the lower
stages of civilization, has been somewhat different from that
of the former.</p>

<p>As has already been pointed out, it is extremely probable
that, among primitive men, the union of the sexes lasted till
after the birth of the offspring. We have also perhaps some
reason to believe that the connection lasted for years. Lieutenant
de Crespigny met Orang-utan families consisting of
male, female, and two young ones, and v. Koppenfels saw
similar groups of the Gorilla; but whether the male was the
father of both the young ones, it is of course impossible to
decide. In any case, there is abundant evidence that marriage
has, upon the whole, become more durable in proportion as
the human race has risen to higher degrees of cultivation,
and that a certain amount of civilization is an essential
condition of the formation of life-long unions.</p>

<p>It is evident that, at the early stage of development at
which women first became valuable as labourers, a wife
was united with her husband by a new bond more lasting
than youth and beauty. The tie was strengthened by the
bride-price and the marriage portion. And greater considera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>tion
for women, a higher development of the paternal feeling,
better forethought for the children’s welfare, and a more
refined love-passion have gradually made it stronger, until it
has become, in many cases, almost indissoluble. A husband
in the most advanced societies is no longer permitted to
repudiate his wife whenever he likes; a wife cannot, without
more ado, divorce herself from her husband. Marriage has
become a contract the keeping of which is superintended by
the State, and which may be dissolved only under certain
stipulated conditions.</p>

<p>Although there can be no doubt that the psychical causes
which have strengthened the marriage tie tend to become
more potent, we must not conclude that divorce will in
future be less frequent and more restricted by the laws than
it is now in European countries. It must be remembered
that the laws of divorce in Christian Europe owe
their origin to an idealistic religious commandment which,
interpreted in its literal sense, gave rise to legal prescriptions
far from harmonizing with the mental and social life of the
mass of the people. The powerful authority of the Roman
Church was necessary to enforce the dogma that marriage
is indissoluble. The Reformation introduced somewhat
greater liberty in this respect, and modern legislation has
gone further in the same direction.</p>

<small>SUMMARY</small></h2>


<p>Our investigation has now come to an end. The development
of human marriage in all its aspects has been examined,
according to the method suggested in the introductory chapter.
Many of the conclusions are more or less hypothetical, but not
a few, I think, are necessary deductions from trustworthy
evidence. As they are based on a great accumulation of
facts, it may be well to present a general view of the argument
as a whole.</p>

<p>We defined marriage as a more or less durable connection
between male and female, lasting beyond the mere act of
propagation till after the birth of the offspring. It is found
among many of the lower animals, it occurs as a rule among
the anthropomorphous apes, and it is universal among mankind.
It is closely connected with parental duties: the
immediate care of the children belongs chiefly to the mother,
whilst the father is the protector and guardian of the family.
Being a necessary requirement for the existence of certain
species, it obviously owes its origin to an instinct developed
through the powerful influence of natural selection. If, as
seems probable, there was a human pairing season in early
times, the continued excitement of the sexual instinct cannot
have played a part in the origin of human marriage—assuming
that the institution existed among primitive men. And
it is highly probable that it did exist, as the marriage of the
Primates seems to be due to the small number of young and
the long period of infancy. Later on, when mankind became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
chiefly carnivorous, the assistance of an adult male became
still more necessary for the subsistence of the children, as
the chase everywhere devolves on the man. The suggestion
that, in olden times, the natural guardian of the children was
not the father, but the maternal uncle, has no foundation in
fact; neither has the hypothesis that all the males of the
tribe indiscriminately were their guardians. All the evidence
we possess tends to show that among our earliest human
ancestors the family, not the tribe, formed the nucleus of
every social group, and, in many cases, was itself perhaps the
only social group. The man-like apes are not gregarious,
and the solitary life they generally lead is almost certainly
due chiefly to the difficulty they experience in getting
sufficient quantities of food. We may infer that our fruit-eating
human or half-human ancestors were not more gregarious
than they. Afterwards, when man passed beyond
his frugivorous stage, he continued, as a rule, this solitary
kind of life, as gregariousness is a disadvantage to all large
animals who live chiefly on flesh. Even now there are
savage peoples of the lowest type who live rather in separate
families than in tribes, and facts indicate that the chief
reason for this is want of sufficient food. The sociability
of man, therefore, sprang in the main from progressive
intellectual and material civilization, whilst the tie that kept
together husband and wife, parents and children, was, if not
the only, at least the principal factor in the earliest forms of
man’s social life. Human marriage, in all probability, is an
inheritance from some ape-like progenitor.</p>

<p>Most anthropologists who have written on prehistoric
customs believe, indeed, that man lived originally in a state
of promiscuity or “communal marriage”; but we have found
that this hypothesis is essentially unscientific. The evidence
given for it consists of notices of some savage nations said
to live promiscuously, and of some curious customs which
are assumed to be survivals from a time when marriage did
not exist. Many of the assertions made as to peoples living
in promiscuous intercourse have, however, been shown to be
erroneous, and the accuracy of the others is at least open to
question. But even if some of the statements were true, it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
be a mistake to infer that these quite exceptional cases represent
a stage of development through which all mankind have
passed; and it is certainly not among the lowest peoples
that sexual relations most nearly approach to promiscuity.
Equally unwarranted is the inference of a primitive condition
of “communal marriage” from the fact that in some parts of
the world the sexes may cohabit freely before marriage.
There are numerous savage and barbarous peoples among
whom sexual intercourse out of wedlock is of rare occurrence,
unchastity on the part of the woman being looked upon as a
disgrace or a crime. Contact with a “higher culture” has
proved pernicious to the morality of savage peoples; and we
have some reason to believe that irregular connections
between the sexes have, on the whole, exhibited a tendency
to increase along with the progress of civilization. Moreover,
free sexual intercourse previous to marriage is quite different
from promiscuity, which involves a suppression of individual
inclinations. The most general form of it is prostitution,
which is rare among peoples living in a state of nature, untouched
by foreign influence. Customs which have been
interpreted as acts of expiation for individual marriage—a
sort of religious prostitution found in the East; the <i>jus
primae noctis</i> granted to the friends of the bridegroom, or to
all the guests at a marriage, or to a particular person, a chief
or a priest; and the practice of lending wives to visitors—may
be far more satisfactorily explained otherwise. This is
true also of the fact that, among certain peoples, courtesans
are held in greater estimation than women married to a single
husband. Mr. Morgan’s view—that the former prevalence of
“marriage in a group” and promiscuity are proved by the
“classificatory system of relationship” in force among many
peoples—presupposes that the nomenclature was founded on
blood-relationship, as near as the parentage of individuals
could be known. But it can scarcely be doubted that the
terms for relationships were originally mere terms of address,
given chiefly with reference to sex and age, as also to the
external, or social, relationship in which the speaker stood
to the person whom he or she addressed. It has been suggested
that the system of “kinship through females only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>”—
implying, chiefly, that children are named after their mothers,
not after their fathers, and that property and rank succeed
exclusively in the female line—is due to the uncertain paternity
which resulted from early promiscuity. But the ties of
blood have exercised a far less direct influence on this system
than is generally assumed. We have seen that there may be
several reasons for naming children after the mother rather
than after the father, apart from any consideration of relationship.
The custom in accordance with which, among
many peoples, a man, on marrying, goes to live with his wife
in the house of her father deserves special notice in this
connection. It is probable that the causes which make
children take their mother’s name have also directly influenced
the rules of succession, but the power of the name itself
seems to have been of even higher importance. Moreover,
so far as we know, there is no general coincidence of what
we consider moral and immoral habits with the prevalence
of the male and female line among existing savages; and
among various peoples the male line prevails, although paternity
is often actually uncertain on account of their polyandrous
marriage customs. Avowed recognition of kinship in
the female line only, by no means implies an unconsciousness
of male kinship. Finally, there are many rude peoples who
exhibit no traces at all of a system of “kinship through
females only.” Thus the facts put forward in support of the
hypothesis of promiscuity do not entitle us to assume that
promiscuity has ever been the prevailing form of sexual
relations even among a single people, whilst the hypothesis
is opposed to all the correct ideas we are able to form with
regard to the early state of man. Promiscuous intercourse
between the sexes tends to a pathological condition very unfavourable
to fecundity; and the almost universal prevalence
of jealousy among peoples unaffected by foreign influence,
as well as among the lower mammals, makes it most unlikely
that promiscuity ever prevailed at any stage of human
development. As we have seen, the idea that a woman
belongs exclusively to one man is so deeply rooted among
various peoples that it has led to several revolting practices.</p>

<p>In the chapter on ‘Marriage and Celibacy’ we noted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
the single state is comparatively rare among savage and
barbarous races, who, as a rule, marry earlier than civilized
men. A celibate is, indeed, looked upon almost as an unnatural
being. Very much the same was the case with the
ancient civilized nations both of the Old World and the New,
as is still the case in the East. In modern civilization, on
the other hand, there are several factors—partly economical,
partly psychical—unfavourable to marriage. As a consequence,
the proportion of unmarried people has been gradually
increasing in Europe, and the age at which people marry
has risen. A curious kind of celibacy, met with among various
peoples at different stages, is the enforced celibacy of persons
devoted to religion. This evidently depends upon the notion
that sexual intercourse is impure—a notion which seems to
have grown up originally from the instinctive feeling against
intercourse between members of the same family or household.</p>

<p>In the courtship of almost all animal species the male
plays the most active part, and has generally to fight with
other males for the possession of the female. The same was
no doubt the case with our early human ancestors, and this
mode of courtship survives even now among some of the lower
races. Much more commonly, however, courtship means on
the part of the man a prolonged making of love; and the
woman is far from being completely passive. We have seen
how savage men and women in various ways endeavour to
make themselves attractive to the opposite sex:—by ornamenting,
mutilating, painting, and tattooing themselves. That
these practices essentially subserve this end appears chiefly
from the fact that the time selected for them is the age of
puberty. It seems also probable that clothing, at least in a
great many cases, was originally adopted for a similar reason,
and that the feeling of shame, far from being the original
cause of man’s covering his nakedness, is, on the contrary, a
result of this custom.</p>

<p>Whilst the men are generally the courters, the women may
in many, perhaps most, cases accept or refuse their proposals
at pleasure. Though a daughter among the lower races is
regarded as an object of property, and is in many instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
betrothed in her earliest youth, women are not, as a rule,
married without having any voice of their own in the matter.
Among existing savages their liberty of selection is very
considerable, and under more primitive conditions—when
every grown-up individual earned his or her own living, when
there was, strictly speaking, no labour, and when a daughter
consequently was neither a slave nor an object of trade—woman
was doubtless even more free in that respect than she
is now among most of the lower races. At a latter stage the
case was different. Among peoples who have reached a
relatively high degree of civilization the father’s power, in
connection with a more fully developed system of ancestor-worship,
has invariably become more extensive, more absolute.
Not only the full-grown daughter, but the full-grown
son, who among savages enjoys perfect independence, stands
so much in awe of the father that, among many of these
peoples, no marriage is concluded without his consent. We
have given some account of this strengthened paternal authority
among various nations; we have found that it has
formed only a transitional stage in the history of human
institutions; and we have indicated the stages of its gradual
decline.</p>

<p>The important subject of sexual selection has necessarily
claimed a good deal of attention. In an introductory chapter
we pointed out the contradiction between Mr. Darwin’s
theories of natural and sexual selection, and endeavoured to
show that the sexual selection of the lower animals is entirely
subordinate to the great law of the survival of the fittest.
From the way in which the sexual colours, odours, and sounds
of animals are distributed among different species, we drew the
conclusion that, though they are always to a certain extent
hurtful to the species, they are upon the whole advantageous,
inasmuch as they make it easier for the sexes to find each
other; whereas if we accept Mr. Darwin’s theory, we are
compelled to suppose that the inexplicable æsthetic sense
on which his hypothesis is founded, has been developed in
the way most dangerous to the species. We also found
that there are facts incompatible with Mr. Darwin’s explanation
of the connection between love and beauty in mankind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
and of the origin of the different human races. There is an ideal
of beauty common to the whole human race; but this ideal is a
mere abstraction, as general similarities in taste are accompanied
by specific differences. Men and women find beauty in
the full development of the visible characteristics belonging to
the human organism in general; of those peculiar to the sex;
of those peculiar to the race. As a certain kind of constitution
is best suited for certain conditions of life, and the
racial type is on the whole that which best harmonizes with
the external relations in which the respective peoples live, we
may infer that the full development of racial characters indicates
health, that a deviation from them indicates disease.
Physical beauty is therefore in every respect the outward
manifestation of physical perfection, and the development of
the instinct which prefers beauty to ugliness, healthiness to
disease, is evidently within the power of natural selection.
According to Mr. Darwin, racial differences are due to the
different standards of beauty, whereas, according to the
theory indicated in this book, the different standards of
beauty are due to racial differences. We have seen that the
racial peculiarities stand in some connection with the external
circumstances in which the various races live. But, as we do
not know that acquired characters are transmitted from
parent to offspring, it is exceedingly doubtful whether the differences
are the inherited effects of conditions of life to which
previous generations have been subject. It seems most
probable that they are due to natural selection, which has
preserved and intensified such congenital variations as were
most in accordance with the conditions under which the
various races lived.</p>

<p>Under the head of the ‘Law of Similarity’ we dealt with
the powerful instinct which, as a rule, keeps animals from
pairing with individuals belonging to another species, and
found the origin of this aversion in the infertility of first
crosses and hybrids. No such instinct can be said to keep
the various human races apart from one another; and it is
not known that the diversities even between the races which
least resemble each other are not so great but that, under
favourable conditions, a mixed race may be produced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
Closely akin to the horror of bestiality is the horror of
incest, which, almost without exception, is a characteristic of
the races of men, though the degrees within which intercourse
is forbidden vary in an extraordinary degree. It is nearly
universally abominated between parents and children, generally
between brothers and sisters, often between cousins, and,
among a great many peoples uninfluenced by modern civilization,
between all the members of the tribe or clan. We
criticized the theories set forth by various writers as to the
origin of such prohibitions. To each of these theories there
are special objections; and all of them presuppose that men
avoid incestuous marriages only because they are taught to
do so. As a matter of fact, the home is kept pure from
incestuous intercourse neither by laws, nor by customs, nor
by education, but by an instinct which under normal circumstances
makes sexual love between the nearest kin a
psychical impossibility. Of course there is no innate
aversion to marriage with near relations; but there is an
innate aversion to marriage between persons living very
closely together from early youth, and, as such persons
are in most cases related, this feeling displays itself chiefly as
a horror of intercourse between near kin. The existence of
an innate aversion of this kind is proved, not only by
common experience, but by an abundance of ethnographical
facts which show that it is not in the first place by degrees
of consanguinity, but by close living together, that prohibitory
laws against intermarriage are determined. Thus
many peoples have a rule of local exogamy, which is quite
independent of kinship. The extent to which, among various
nations, relatives are not allowed to intermarry, is obviously
nearly connected with their close living together. There is
so strong a coincidence (as statistical data prove) between
exogamy and the “classificatory system of relationship”—which
system springs, to a great extent, from the close living
together of considerable numbers of kinsfolk—that they
must, in fact, be regarded as two sides of one institution.
Prohibitions of incest are very often more or less one-sided,
applying more extensively either to the kinsfolk on the
father’s side or to those on the mother’s, according as descent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
is reckoned through men or women; and we have seen that
the line of descent is intimately connected with local relationships.
In a large number of cases, however, prohibitions of
intermarriage are only indirectly influenced by the close living
together. Aversion to the intermarriage of persons who live in
intimate connection with each other has provoked prohibitions
of the intermarriage of relations; and, as kinship is traced
by means of a system of names, the name comes to be considered
identical with relationship. Generally speaking, the
feeling that two persons are intimately connected in some
way or other may, through an association of ideas, give rise
to the notion that intercourse between them is incestuous.
There are exceptions to the rule that close living together
inspires an aversion to intermarriage. But most of the
recorded instances of intermarriage of brother and sister
refer to royal families, and are brought about simply by pride
of birth. Incestuous unions may also take place on account
of extreme isolation, and certain instances of such connection
are evidently the results of vitiated instincts. Marriage between
a half-brother and a half-sister, however, is not necessarily
contrary to the principle here laid down, as polygyny
breaks up each family into as many sub-families as there are
wives who have children. The question arose:—Why is a
feeling of disgust associated with the idea of marriage
between persons who have lived in a long-continued, intimate
relationship from a period of life at which the action
of desire is naturally out of the question? We found an
answer in the evil effects resulting from consanguineous
marriages. It seems to be necessary for the welfare of the
species that the sexual elements which unite shall be somewhat
different from, as it is necessary that they shall be in
some way similar to, one another. The injurious results of
self-fertilization among plants and of close interbreeding
among animals appear to prove the existence of such a law,
and it is impossible to believe that it does not apply to man
also. We stated several facts pointing in this direction, and
found reason to believe that consanguineous marriages are
much more injurious in savage regions, where the struggle for
existence is often very severe, than they have proved to be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
civilized society. We also observed that no evidence which
can stand the test of scientific investigation has hitherto been
adduced against the view that consanguineous marriages, in
some way or other, are more or less detrimental to the species.
Through natural selection an instinct must have been developed,
powerful enough, as a rule, to prevent injurious
unions. This instinct displays itself simply as an aversion on
the part of individuals to union with others with whom they
have lived, but as these are for the most part blood-relations,
the result is the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>We proceeded to consider sexual selection as influenced by
affection, sympathy, and calculation. We found that love
has only slowly become the refined feeling it is in the minds
of cultivated persons in modern times, although conjugal
affection is far from being unknown, even among very rude
savages. The endogamous rules which prevent different races,
nations, or tribes, hereditary castes, classes, and adherents
of different religions from intermarrying are due to want of
sympathy, and have gradually lost their importance according
as altruism and religious toleration have increased, and
civilization has diminished the barriers which separate different
nations and the various classes of society.</p>

<p>As regards the mode of contracting marriage, we inferred—from
the universality of the horror of incest, and from the
difficulty a savage man has in procuring a wife in a friendly
manner without making up for the loss he inflicts on her
father—that marriage by capture must have been very
common at that stage of social development when family
ties had become stronger, and man lived in small groups of
nearly related persons, but when the idea of barter had
scarcely presented itself to his mind. We saw that marriage
by capture was succeeded by marriage by purchase, as barter
in general has followed upon robbery. Again, at a later
stage, some feeling of shame was attached to the idea of
selling a daughter, and marriage by purchase was abandoned.
Its gradual disappearance took place in two different ways.
On the one hand, the purchase became a symbol, appearing
as a sham sale in the marriage ceremonies or as an exchange
of presents; on the other hand, the purchase-sum was trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>formed
into the morning gift and the dotal portion, a part—afterwards
the whole—being given to the bride either directly
by the bridegroom or by her father. These transformations
of marriage by purchase have taken place, not only in the
history of the great civilized nations, but among several
peoples who are still in a savage or semi-civilized state. As
a rule, however, the marriage portion plays no important part
in savage life, being chiefly due to a feeling of respect and
sympathy for the weaker sex, which, on the whole, is
characteristic of a higher civilization. Very often it is
intended to be a settlement for the wife in case the marriage
be dissolved through the husband’s death or otherwise,
although it may have the meaning of a return gift, or it may
imply that the wife as well as the husband is expected to
contribute to the expenses of the joint household.</p>

<p>Having noted the growth of marriage ceremonies and
religious rites, we passed to the forms of human marriage.
Polygyny was permitted by most of the ancient peoples
within the historic period, and is at present permitted by
several civilized nations and by the majority of savage
tribes. Yet, among not a few savage and barbarous races it
is almost unknown, or even prohibited; and almost everywhere
it is confined to the smaller part of the people, the
vast majority being monogamous. Moreover, where polygyny
occurs, it is modified, as a rule, in two ways that tend towards
monogamy: through the higher position granted to one of
the wives, generally the first married, and through the favour
constantly shown by the husband to the wife he likes
best. Among certain peoples polyandry occurs, and, like
polygyny, is modified in a monogamous direction, the first
husband usually being the chief husband. Among the
causes by which the forms of marriage are influenced, the
numerical proportion between the sexes plays an important
part. In some countries there are more men than women,
in others more women than men. This disproportion is
due to various causes, such as female infanticide, war, and
disparity in the number of the sexes at birth. There are facts
which seem to show that in rough mountainous countries
more boys are born than girls, and that consanguineous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
marriages produce a considerable excess of male births. If
this be so, it can hardly be a mere coincidence that polyandry
occurs chiefly among mountaineers and peoples who are
endogamous in a very high degree. As for polygyny, there are
several reasons why a man may desire to possess more than
one wife. Among many peoples the husband has to live apart
from his wife during her pregnancy, and as long as she suckles
her child. Female youth and beauty have for men a powerful
attraction, and among peoples at the lower stages of civilization
women generally become old much sooner than in more
advanced communities. The liking of men for variety is also
a potent factor; and to have many wives is to have many
labourers. The barrenness of a wife is another very common
reason for the choice of a new partner, as desire for offspring,
for various reasons, is universal in mankind. In a savage and
barbarous state a man’s power and wealth are proportionate
to the number of his offspring. Nevertheless, however desirable
polygyny may be from the man’s point of view, it is prohibited
among many peoples, and among most of the others it is
exceptional. Where the amount of female labour is limited,
and no accumulated property exists, it may be very difficult
for a man to keep a plurality of wives. Again, where female
labour is of considerable value, the necessity of paying the
purchase-sum for a wife is a hindrance to polygyny, which
can be overcome only by the wealthier men. Polygyny
implies a violation of the feelings of women; hence, where
due respect is paid to these, monogamy is considered
the only proper form of marriage. The refined passion of
love, which depends not only on external attractions, but on
sympathy arising from mental qualities, forms a tie between
husband and wife which lasts for life; and the true monogamous
instinct, the absorbing passion for one, is a powerful
obstacle to polygynous habits. It is certain that polygyny
has been less prevalent at the lowest stages of civilization—where
wars do not seriously disturb the proportion of
the sexes; where life is chiefly supported by hunting, and
female labour is consequently of slight value; where there
is no accumulation of wealth and no distinction of class—than
it is at somewhat higher stages; and it seems probable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
that monogamy prevailed almost exclusively among our
earliest human ancestors. But, though civilization up to a
certain point is favourable to polygyny, its higher forms invariably
and necessarily lead to monogamy. We have
noted that polygyny has, in many ways, become less desirable
for the civilized man than it was for his barbarian and savage
ancestors, and that other causes have co-operated to produce
the same result. Again, polyandry, being due to an excess
of men and presupposing an abnormally feeble disposition
to jealousy, must at all times have been exceptional; there
is no solid evidence for the theory that in early times it was
the rule. On the contrary, this form of marriage seems to
require a certain degree of civilization. It was probably,
in most cases, an expression of fraternal benevolence on
the part of the eldest brother, and, if additional wives were
afterwards acquired, it led to group marriages of the Toda
type.</p>

<p>As a general rule, human marriage is not necessarily contracted
for life, and among most uncivilized and many advanced
peoples, a man may divorce his wife whenever he
likes. Nevertheless, divorce is an exception among a great
many races, even among races of the lowest type; and
numerous nations consider, or have considered, marriage a
union which must not be dissolved by the husband, except for
certain reasons stipulated by custom or law. We also noted
instances in which the wife may separate from her husband.
The causes by which the duration of human marriage is
influenced are, on the whole, but not exactly the same as
those which determine the form of marriage; and, though
monogamy frequently coexists with great stability of marriage,
this is scarcely the case in the rudest condition of man.
Marriage, generally speaking, has become more durable in
proportion as the human race has advanced.</p>

<p>Marriage has thus been subject to evolution in various
ways, though the course of evolution has not been always
the same. The dominant tendency of this process at its later
stages has been the extension of the wife’s rights. A wife is
no longer the husband’s property; and, according to modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
ideas, marriage is, or should be, a contract on the footing
of perfect equality between the sexes. The history of human
marriage is the history of a relation in which women have
been gradually triumphing over the passions, the prejudices,
and the selfish interests of men.</p>

<p class="half-title"><small>THE</small><br />

HISTORY OF HUMAN MARRIAGE</p>


<p class="center"><small>BY</small></p>

<p class="center">EDWARD WESTERMARCK<br />

<small>LECTURER ON SOCIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HELSINGFORS</small></p>

<p class="center"><i>WITH PREFACE BY DR. A. R.  WALLACE</i></p>

<p class="center"><small>Third Edition. 8vo. 14s. net.</small></p>


<p class="center">Some Opinions of the Press on the First Edition:—</p>


<p class="center"><i>Edward B. Tylor in</i> <b>The Academy</b>, <i>October 3, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“A volume which at once takes an important place in the
much debated problem of primitive society.... The distinguishing
character of Dr. Westermarck’s whole treatise is his
vigorous effort to work the biology-side and the culture-side
of anthropology into one connected system; and there can
be no doubt of the value of the resulting discussions, which
will develop further as the inquiry goes on in this direction.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Spectator</b>, <i>February 13, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wallace’s eulogium of the author’s clearness of style
and command of English will be echoed by every reader.
But the book is much more than a clever literary performance.
It is by far the most important contribution to our
knowledge of a profoundly interesting chapter in human
history that has yet appeared.... Not a page is without its
interest.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Athenæum</b>, <i>August 8, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“We are inclined to concur in Mr. Wallace’s opinion. It
must be added that the work is written in excellent English,
that it deals with delicate and difficult questions in a tone of
faultless taste, that its style is clear and its matter exceedingly
well arranged, and that it is readable from beginning to
end.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Mind</b>, <i>October, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“The author’s equipment, logical as well as psychological,
for his task is of a very exceptional order.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Westminster Review</b>, <i>August, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“A very able volume on the subject of human marriage,
which, in our opinion, is calculated to set the world thinking
again with a view to correcting preconceived ideas.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Times</b>, <i>July 2, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“Dr. Westermarck brings to the treatment of his subject
the accumulated results of very extensive study and the
dialectical resources of a powerful and logical mind.... In
this judgment (Mr. Wallace’s) we fully concur.... Mr.
Westermarck propounds views which are at once novel and
ingenious, and supports them with great variety of illustrations
and great cogency of reasoning.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Scotsman</b>, <i>July 6, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“Scientific precision has rarely been attained in a style
more agreeable and elegant by any indigenous writer. Mr.
Westermarck’s book would have been deeply interesting
even if it had been less well written.... The results of his
erudition form a mountain of wealth.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>St. James’s Gazette</b>, <i>July 20, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“Of the value of his (the author’s) researches ... we
cannot speak too highly. His book is in every way deserving
of the high eulogy pronounced on it by Mr. Wallace.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Manchester Guardian</b>, <i>July, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Westermarck has established his position among the
first of historical anthropologists, he has thrown light upon
many of the unsolved mysteries in the history of the human
race, and he has swept out of the way several theories which
have hitherto blocked the path to a right solution of the
main question at issue.... The book affords a model for
future investigators in this field. It is no small compliment
to English anthropology that the author has chosen to write
his book in English.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Anti-Jacobin</b>, <i>July 18, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“Certainly the most valuable of recent contributions to the
literature of a deeply interesting theme.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>From a leading article in</i> <b>Liverpool Daily Post</b>, <i>July 24, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“There is every reason to suppose that this deeply interesting
book will find a host of readers even among those
who are attracted by facts for their own sake rather than
for the theories that may be drawn from them.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Guardian</b>, <i>November 11, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“Not only profoundly learned but delightfully readable.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Warrington Guardian</b>, <i>September 16, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“A monumental book.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>National Observer</b>, <i>August 1, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“An invaluable contribution to science, ... and we confidently
recommend Mr. Westermarck’s <i>History of Human
Marriage</i>, not only to all anthropologists, but to all them
that love good reading.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>Sussex Daily News</b>, <i>October 7, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“One of the most readable works in the whole range of
scientific writing.... A comparatively unknown student until
the publication of this work, Dr. Westermarck has now
taken his position in the very front rank of historical anthropologists.
No library of any scientific pretentions can
dispense with the <i>History of Human Marriage</i>, and every
public library in the country should possess a copy.”</p>


<p class="center"><b>The Critic</b> (<i>New York</i>), <i>September, 12, 1891</i>.</p>

<p>“A work of the first importance.... The excellence of
expression corresponds to the elevation of sentiment apparent
throughout.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>L. Marillier, in</i> <b>Revue générale des Sciences</b>,
<i>September 15, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“Le livre de M. Westermarck est, sans contredit, l’une des
meilleurs monographies sociologiques qui aient été faites, et
c’est à l’heure actuelle l’ouvrage le plus complet, le plus riche
en informations que l’on possède sur cette question du mariage
et celui où l’on trouve la plus sûre et la plus pénétrante
critique.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>M. Boule, in</i> <b>L’Anthropologie</b>, <i>November-December, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“Je ne connais pas un volume où plus de faits, plus de
recherches, plus de science, soient accumulés.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>René de Kérallain, in</i> <b>Revue générale du Droit, de la
Législation et de la Jurisprudence</b>, <i>May-June, 1893</i>.</p>

<p>“M. Westermarck s’est trouvé du coup écrire un livre qui
s’est placé au premier rang du genre, qui a surpris ses
contradicteurs et qui déjà fait autorité.... Selon nous, ce
livre doit faire époque.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>Prof. Lujo Brentano, in</i> <b>Zeitschrift für Social und
Wirthschaftsgeschichte</b>, 1893.</p>

<p>“Ein Werk von erstaunlicher Gelehrsamkeit und ungewöhnlichem
Scharfsinn.... Voll und ganz stimme ich Alfred R.
Wallace bei.”</p>

As regards the Melanesians, Dr. Codrington remarks (<i>loc. cit.</i> pp. 22,
<i>et seq.</i>): ‘Speaking generally, it may be said that to a Melanesian man
all women, of his own generation at least, are either sisters or wives, to
the Melanesian woman all men are either brothers or husbands.... It
must not be understood that a Melanesian regards all women who are
not of his own division as, in fact, his wives, or conceives himself to
have rights which he may exercise in regard to those women of them
who are unmarried; but the women who may be his wives by marriage
and those who cannot possibly be so, stand in a widely different relation
to him.'</p></div>

With reference to the Tahitians, Forster says (‘Voyage round the
World,’ vol. ii. p. 132), ‘We have been told a wanton tale of promiscuous
embraces, where every woman is common to every man: but when we
inquired for a confirmation of this story from the natives, we were soon
convinced that it must, like many others, be considered as a groundless
invention of a traveller’s gay fancy.’ Regarding the Peruvian natives
alleged to live in a state of promiscuity, Garcilasso de la Vega assures us
(<i>loc. cit.</i> vol. ii. p. 443) that he saw them with his own eyes when on his
way to Spain, for the ship stopped on their coast for <i>three</i> days.</p></div>

In dealing with the pretended group-marriages of the Australians, we
have noted the distortion of facts to which Mr. Morgan’s hypothesis has
given rise. Nowhere has this distortion appeared in an odder way than
in Professor Bernhöft’s pamphlet, entitled ‘Verwandtschaftsnamen und
Eheformen der nordamerikanischen Volksstämme.’ The author, misled
by the systems of nomenclature, asserts that even now group-marriages
are extremely common (have ‘eine ungeheure Verbreitung’) not only
among the Australians, but also throughout America and Africa, and in
many parts of Asia (pp. 8, 16). In a paper of more recent date (‘Altindische
Familien-Organisation,’ in ‘Zeitschr. f. vgl. Rechtswiss.,’ vol. ix. p. 7),
however, Professor Bernhöft admits that the actual practice has <i>mostly</i>
become different from that which the terms indicate, and that the progress
to individual marriage has already often taken place.</p></div>

Among the Kaniagmuts and Aleuts (Dall, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 402), as also occasionally
among other North American tribes, certain men were dressed
and brought up like women, and never married; whereas, among the
Eastern Eskimo, there are some women who refuse to accept husbands,
preferring to adopt masculine manners, following the deer on the mountains,
trapping and fishing for themselves (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 139).</p></div>

Speaking of the Santals, Sir W. W.  Hunter remarks ('Rural Bengal,’
vol i. p.  205), ‘In the tropical forest, a youth of sixteen or seventeen is
as able to provide for a family as ever he will be; and a leaf hut, with a
few earthen or brazen pots, is all the establishment a Santal young lady
expects.’ This holds good not only for the savages of the tropics.</p></div>

Moseley, ‘On the Inhabitants of the Admiralty Islands,’ in ‘Jour.
Anthr. Inst.,’ vol. vi. p. 400. Short hair is often regarded as a symbol of
chastity. Every Buddhist ‘novice’—that is, a person admitted to the first
degree of monkhood—has to cut off his hair, in order to prove that ‘he
is ready to give up the most beautiful and highly-prized of all his ornaments
for the sake of a religious life’ (Monier Williams, ‘Buddhism,’ p. 306);
and, in Mexico, the religious virgins, as also men who decided upon
a life of chastity, had their hair cut (Acosta, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. ii. p. 333;
Bancroft, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. ii. pp. 251, <i>et seq.</i>). A similar idea probably underlies
the custom which requires that women, when they marry, shall be deprived
of their hair, the husband trying in this way to preserve the fidelity of his
wife (see Wilkes, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. iii. p. 354; Waitz-Gerland, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. vi. p. 567;
Palmer, in ‘Jour. Anthr. Inst.,’ vol. xiii. p. 286; de Rubruquis, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 32;
Heriot, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 335); whilst many men in New Guinea and Bornu
deprive their wives of all ornaments (‘Ymer,’ vol. vi. p. 154; Barth,
‘Reisen,’ vol. iii. p. 31, note). Even at Sparta and Athens, as well as
among the Anglo-Saxons, the bride or newly-married wife had her hair cut
short (Rossbach, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 290). Mr. Wright suggests (‘Womankind in
Western Europe,’ p. 68) that, among the people last mentioned, this was
done in order to show that she had accepted a position of servitude
towards her husband, as the cutting of hair in either sex indicated slavery.
But that this explanation cannot be applied to every case of hair-cutting
appears from the fact, reported by Heriot (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 333), that, among the
Tlascalans, it was customary to shave the head of a newly-married couple,
both man and woman, ‘to denote that all youthful sports ought in that
state to be abandoned.'</p></div>

After this chapter had been prepared for the press, I became acquainted
with Herr Joest’s magnificent work on tattooing (‘Tätowiren, Narbenzeichnen
und Körperbemalen’). Herr Joest, who is an experienced ethnographer,
has come to the same conclusion as myself regarding the origin
of this practice. He says that ‘der hauptsächliche Trieb, welcher beide
Geschlechter bewegt, sich zu tätowiren, <i>der</i> ist, ihre Reize in den Augen
des andern Geschlechts zu erhöhen’ (p. 56). He also observes:—‘Je
weniger sich ein Mensch bekleidet, desto mehr tätowirt er sich, und je
mehr er sich bekleidet, desto weniger thut er letzteres’ (pp. 56, <i>et seq.</i>).</p></div>

Speaking of the naked women of New Ireland, he says (<i>loc. cit.</i> vol.
ii. pp. 103, <i>et seq.</i>), ‘In der That muss ich auch sagen, dass nach kurzer
Zeit, nach einer durchaus nicht lange dauernden Gewöhnung an diese
Sache, man gar nichts anstössiges mehr in diesem gänzlichen Mangel an
Kleidung findet.... Ich habe sehr häufig bemerkt, dass ein Kleid irgend
einer Dame, welches nicht nach der allgemeinen Mode geschnitten war,
mir stärker auffiel als mir der gänzliche Mangel an Bekleidung der
Eingeborenen der tropischen Inseln aufgefallen ist; dazu kommt noch,
dass die Leute dem Beobachter durchaus keine Veranlassung geben, an
etwas unschickliches zu denken. Eine Europaërin, wenn sie auf eine so
glückliche Insel verschlagen und ihrer Kleidung beraubt wäre, würde
selbst nach jahrelangem Aufenthalt in solchen Regionen sich die Hände
vor die Brust oder irgend einen anderen Theil halten und gerade durch
dies Verbergenwollen würde sie die Aufmerksamkeit gegen das zu
Verbergende lenken.'</p></div>

Kane, ‘Arctic Explorations,’ vol ii. p. 114. On the East Coast of
Greenland, according to Dr. Nansen (<i>loc. cit.</i> vol. i. p.  338; vol. ii. p. 277),
the Eskimo, men and women alike, when indoors, are completely naked
with the exception of the ‘nâtit,’ a narrow band about the loins, of
dimensions ‘so extremely small as to make it practically invisible to the
stranger’s inexperienced eye.’ Many, indeed, assume some covering
when Europeans enter their dwellings, but Dr. Nansen thinks this must
be rather from affectation, and a desire to please their visitors, than from
any real feeling of modesty (<i>ibid.</i>, vol. ii. pp. 277, <i>et seq.</i>).</p></div>

Since the appearance of the first edition of this work I have become
acquainted with Mr. Johnston’s book on ‘The River Congo,’ where he
says (p. 418), ‘Clothing was first adopted as a means of decoration rather

the appendages that were afterwards used by a dawning sense of modesty
to conceal them.'</p></div>

Mr. Belt (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 112) has seen the female of <i>Florisuga mellivora</i>
sitting quietly on a branch, and two males displaying their charms in front
of her. ‘One would shoot up like a rocket, then suddenly expanding the
snow-white tail like an inverted parachute, slowly descend in front of her,
turning round gradually to show off both back and front.... The expanded
white tail covered more space than all the rest of the bird, and
was evidently the grand feature in the performance.'</p></div>

According to Professor Vogt (‘Lectures on Man,’ p. 421), the aversion
between allied species in the wild state is more frequently overcome by
the males than by the females; and, in crosses between wild and
domesticated animals, the female generally belongs to the domesticated
species or race (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, ‘Histoire naturelle générale,’
vol. iii. p. 177).</p></div>

This rule does not hold good for all races. Speaking of the natives
of King George’s Sound, Cook remarks (‘Voyage to the Pacific Ocean,’
vol. ii. p. 303) that ‘the women are nearly of the same size, colour, and
form, with the men; from whom it is not easy to distinguish them.’
Ellis states (‘Polynesian Researches,’ vol. i. p.  81) that, among the
Tahitians, the difference between the stature of the male and female sex
is not so great as that which often prevails in Europe. Diodorus Siculus
says (<i>loc. cit.</i> book v. ch. xxxii. § 2) that the Gallic women were as tall as the
men; and Dr. Fritsch asserts (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 398) the same with reference to
the Bushman women of South Africa. Among the Californian Shastika,
according to Mr. Powers (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 244), the women are even
‘larger and stronger-featured, and in every way more respectable,’ than
the men. <i>Cf.</i> Burton, ‘First Footsteps,’ p. 118 (Somals).</p></div>

Mr. Wallace (‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,’

explain, by the principle of natural selection, the origin of human racial
distinctions.</p></div>

A negro child is not born black, but becomes so after some shorter or
longer time (Darwin, ‘The Descent of Man,’ vol. ii. p. 342. Caillié, <i>loc.

adults (Darwin, vol. ii. p. 342. Moseley, in ‘Jour. Anthr. Inst.,’ vol. vi.

Speaking of the Rejangs of Sumatra, Marsden says (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 206),
‘The quick, and to them inexplicable, revolutions of our fashions are
subject of much astonishment, and they naturally conclude that those
modes can have but little intrinsic merit which we are so ready to
change.'</p></div>

Mr. Wallace, in his ‘Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection’
(p. 359), believes that ‘a superior intelligence has guided the
development of man in a definite direction,’ and considers (pp. 348, <i>et
seq.</i>) that the hairless condition of the skin comes under this head. Again,
Mr. Belt’s experience in tropical countries has led him to the conclusion
that, in such parts at least, there is one serious drawback to the advantage
of having the skin covered with hair:—‘It affords cover for parasitical
insects, which, if the skin were naked, might more easily be got
rid of’ (Belt, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 209).</p></div>

Collins, who wrote sixty years before ‘The Origin of Species,’ makes
the following observation regarding the natives about Botany Bay and
Port Jackson (New South Wales):—‘Their sight is peculiarly fine, indeed
their existence very often depends upon the accuracy of it; for a short-sighted
man ... would never be able to defend himself from their spears,
which are thrown with amazing force and velocity’ (Collins, ‘Account of
the English Colony in New South Wales,’ vol. i. pp. 553, <i>et seq.</i>).</p></div>

‘In many nations they cohabited like beasts, without any special wife, but
just as chance directed. Others followed their own desires, without excepting
sisters, daughters, or mothers. Others excepted their mothers
but none else.’ It is said, according to Dr. Hickson (<i>loc. cit.</i> pp. 277,

neighbourhood of Tonsawang, father and daughter, mother and son,
brother and sister, frequently lived together in bonds of matrimony. As

Mr. Huth, in the first edition of his work, ‘The Marriage of Near
Kin,’ suggests (p. 157) that marriage between parents and children is
considered incestuous because marriage between old men and young
women in general is considered so. In the second edition, Mr. Huth
seems to have given up this most unfortunate hypothesis, as he says
(p. 18) that ‘the prohibition of marriage with those who were regarded
as near of kin was derived from the same causes which made exogamy
imperative,’ that is, the causes suggested by Mr. Spencer.</p></div>

of the origin of exogamy, and considers it certain (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 618,
619, 623) that prohibitions of close intermarriage have everywhere
originated in true exogamy.</p></div>

some one else (Fison and Howitt, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 276).</p></div>

rather inclined towards strange females (Darwin, ‘The Descent of Man,’

Williams, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. i. p.  785), Japanese (Küchler, in ‘Trans. As. Soc.
Japan,’ vol. xiii. p. 121), ancient Mexicans (Waitz, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. iv. p. 132).
In this connection should also be noticed the ‘lucky days,’ when matrimony
in general is concluded under the best auspices. In China, these
are especially marked in the almanacks (Montgomery, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. ii.
p. 268). The spring season and the last month in the year are regarded
as the most fortunate nuptial periods in that country (Wells Williams,
vol. i. p.  791), whereas the ninth month is considered very unpropitious
(Gray, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. i. p.  187). Among the Bedouins of Mount
Sinai (Burckhardt, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 152), the Egyptians (Lane, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. i.
pp. 222, <i>et seq.</i>), and the Mohammedan negroes of Senegambia (Reade,
<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 453), Friday is esteemed the most fortunate day for marriage;
while the Copts generally marry on the night preceding Sunday (Lane,
vol. ii. p. 331). In India, the month Phalguna was considered the luckiest
period (v. Bohlen, <i>loc. cit.</i> vol. ii. p. 148), and in Morocco, as I am informed
by Dr. Churcher, the month called Moolood (birth of Mohammed).
Again, in Thuringia, marriages are generally contracted at the time of
the full moon (Schmidt, ‘Sitten und Gebräuche in Thüringen,’ p. 28);
whilst in Orkney and Esthonia, no couple would consent to marry
except at the time of the crescent moon. The same superstition prevailed
among the ancient Hindus, Greeks, and Germans (v. Schroeder, <i>loc. cit.</i>
p. 50). In Scotland, formerly, nearly all avoided contracting marriage
in May, and the Lowlanders were disinclined to marry on Friday (Rogers,
<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 112). The Romans considered May and the first half of June
an unlucky period (Rossbach, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 265). In Egypt, it is a common
belief that, if any one make a marriage contract in the month of Moharram,
the marriage will be unhappy and soon dissolved, hence few
persons do so (Lane, vol. i. p.  219, note *). For ‘unlucky days’ among
the tribes of the Indian Archipelago, see Wilken, in ‘Bijdragen,’ &amp;c.,
ser. v. vol. i. p.  380.</p></div>

Jacobs, in ‘Jour. Anthr. Inst.,’ vol. xv. p. 26. Mr. Jacobs thinks
that English Jews marry their first cousins to the extent of 7·5 per cent.
of all marriages, against a proportion of about 2 per cent. for England
generally, as calculated by Professor G. H.  Darwin. M. Stieda, in his
‘Eheschliessungen in Elsass-Lothringen’ (1872-1876), gives the proportion
of consanguineous marriages among Jews as 23·02 per thousand,
against 1·86 for Protestants, and 9·97 for Catholics (Jacobs, ‘Studies in
Jewish Statistics,’ p. 53).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3028_3028" href="#FNanchor_3028_3028" class="label">3028</a>
According to Mr. Jacob’s comprehensive manuscript collection of
Jewish statistics, which he has kindly allowed me to examine, the
average proportion of male and female Jewish births registered in various
countries is 114·50 males to 100 females, whilst the average proportion
among the non-Jewish population of the corresponding countries is 105·25
males to 100 females. But Mr. Jacobs thinks that the accuracy of these
statistics may be called in question, as the abnormal figures for Austria
(128 to 100, in the years 1861-1870) and Russia (129 to 100, in the
years 1867-1870), when compared with those for Posen (108 to 100, in
the years 1819-1873) and Prussia (108 to 100, in the years 1875-1881),
render it likely that some uniform error occurs in the registration of
Jewish female children in Eastern Europe. It has also been suggested
that less care is taken in the registration of females among poor Jews.
Moreover, still-born children are not included in the rates of births, and
this certainly affects the figures as to sex, because, parturition being more
difficult in the case of males than in that of females, there are not so
many still-born females as still-born males (v. Oettingen, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 57).
E. Nagel attributes the excess of male births among Jews to the greater
care which Jewish wives take of their health during pregnancy, as also
to the smaller number of illegitimate births. But Mr. Jacobs believes
that the ratio of male births is greater among Jews than among non-Jewish
Europeans, even if we take this objection into account.</p></div>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
